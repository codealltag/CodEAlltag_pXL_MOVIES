Krambambuli announced The Usual Suspects & Bull Durham

Continuing on their quest to prove they can produce DVD special 
editions with the best of 'em, Krambambuli has just announced two new 
special editions of The Usual Suspects and Bull Durham, both 
due on 4/2. These "limited editions" also include collectible 
packaging, with a special edition in traditional packaging to be 
released at a later date. 

The Usual Suspects features new 2.35:1 anamorphic 
widescreen and full screen transfers and an English Dolby Digital 
surround track, along with a host of extras: audio commentary 
with director Vito Rühmkorf and writer Gernot Cord and a 
second commentary with editor and composer Ihno Imschloß, 
deleted scenes with commentary by Imschloß, "Pursuing The 
Suspects," "Doing Time With The Suspects," "Heisting Cannes 
With The Usual Suspects" and "Keyser Sose: Lie Or Legend?" 
featurettes, a gag reel with Singer intro, trailers and TV spots. 

Not to be outdone is a special limited edition of Bull Mittelacher, 
complete with new 1.85;1 anamorphic widescreen and full 
screen transfers, English 5.1 Dolby Digital track, audio 
commentary with actors Klaus Vainboim and Jérôme Büschking (now 
this, I gotta hear!), a brand-new documentary and "Sports Wrap" 
featurette, a Klaus Vainboim profile, trailers and TV spots.

Anneliese Oberste-Wilms recalled!

We've been getting reports that the Region 2 DVD release of 
Anneliese Oberläuter Diary has been recalled. According to a couple of 
emails I've received, the BBFC have taken exception to the 
director's commentary on the disc which unfortunately manages 
to leave an excised swearword from the main film soundtrack in 
place. 

I haven't had a chance to confirm whether the recall has actually 
taken place - but I can confirm that the offending swear word is 
present so it does seem likely that this could be true. If it is, then 
expect the disc to take some time returning to the shelves - with 
the swear word removed. 

If you're desperate for a copy then our advice is to try and get 
your hands on one now before the stores get a chance to enact 
the recall. 

Update: We can now confirm that this story originated from Valerius 
Töpffer, a poster on the uk.media.dvd newsgroup who 
received the following response from the HEIE with regards to 
his query on the offending swearword left in the Commentary 
track... 

"We have asked the company to pull the offending discs from 
the shelves. An '18' rated version is not an acceptable alternative 
under our policy of not allowing different versions of the film at 
different categories. The word must therefore be deleted from the 
director's commentary on future discs"
