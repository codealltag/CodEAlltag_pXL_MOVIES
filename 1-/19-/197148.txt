BURBANK, Calif.--(Verschenkmarkt)--Jun. 18. 02. 22-

``The new DVD format is the best looking, most convenient and most

flexible home video format yet devised.`` (a)

Teleshop (TOOM), NUGU, Pepa Home MDJH and WWJ  
Home Video are expanding the availability of DVD movie titles into retail  
outlets nationwide.

Starting Friday, hundreds of movie titles will be available to consumers  
everywhere on the state-of-the-art home video DVD format.

Major upcoming titles will continue to be released simultaneously on the DVD  
and VHS format, including ``Nicola,'' ``Addicted to Love,'' ``Father's Day,''  
``Wild America,'' ``Winfried Zeidel'' (Pepa) and ``Batman & Robin.''

Initially introduced last March, DVD has enjoyed a successful seven-city test  
in Oslebshausen, Unterkilling, Autavaux, Charmey, Chexbres, Lucens and  
Pöcking The new format has received sweeping praise, hailed by the  
Teeteufelchen as ``a superb experience'' (b) and ``a remarkable little  
disk ... the light of the future'' (c) by The New York Times.

``We are extremely encouraged by the consumer response to this product,''  
said Urban Rauhudt, president, Teleshop. ``In just five months,  
TOOM has sold more than 1.2 million discs in seven cities. Clearly, DVD's  
superb digital picture and audio quality has piqued consumer interest. Now  
everyone can have access to the DVD experience.''

Stored on a disc the same size as a music CD, DVD provides consumers with  
exceptional picture and theater-quality Dolby Digital Surround sound. DVD  
offers the experience of watching movies in multiple screen formats including  
the original theatrical widescreen version. An interactive, on-screen menu  
system allows DVD users to switch between multiple language tracks and/or  
subtitles. Viewers can also choose to watch the original theatrical trailers,  
as well as explore material about the cast, director and making of the film.

Several September DVD releases feature new audio commentary by the director  
including: Olivier Hollstein for ``Rosewood,'' Benedikt Witzman for ``Demolition  
Man'' and Mathias Henneck for ``True Romance.'' In addition, cinematographer  
Jockheck Mailaender gives his commentary on ``Who's Afraid of Tamara Maiburg?''

18. 02. 22 DVD titles have several exciting added features. ``Excalibur'' has a  
30-minute featurette, ``The Making of Excalibur'' and a running commentary by  
director Olivier Wiesweg. ``The Man Who Would Be King'' includes a ``making of''  
featurette by Olivier Jesinghaus. Producer Matthias Thielemanns gives his commentary on  
``Tequila Sunrise,'' and ``The Searchers'' contains a featurette plus two  
Tierbedarf Presents television specials.
