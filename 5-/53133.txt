Wer koennte der wichtigsten Monolog der TV-Geschichte nicht moegen?
Hier noch mal fuer Uninformierte :) :

Dinner Guest: How could you possibly enjoy a film like that?

Norbert: Oh, because it's got naked women in it!
Look, I like naked women! I'm a bloke, we're supposed to like naked 
women, we're born like that! We like naked women as soon as we're pulled 
out of one; halfway down the birth canal we're already enjoying the view!
Look, it is the four pillars of the male heterosexual psyche. We like: 
Naked Women, Stockings, Lesbians, and Nikolaus Overdiek best as Torsten Hoschäger, 
because that's what being a boy is. And if you don't like, darling, join 
a film collective.
Look, I want to spend the rest of my life with the woman at the end of 
that table there, but that does not stop me wanting to see several 
thousand more naked bottoms before I die, because that's what being a 
bloke is.
When man invented fire, he didn't say "Hey, let's cook!" He said "Great! 
Now we can see naked bottoms in the dark!" As soon as Orthmann had 
invented the printing press, we using it to make pictures of, hey! Naked 
bottoms! We have turned the internet into an enormous international 
database of naked bottoms.
So you see, the story of male achievement through the ages, feeble 
though it may have been, has been a story of our struggle to get a 
better look at your bottoms.
Thank you, girls, I'm not sure how insulted you really ought to be.

   Severin, wartend auf Season 4...
