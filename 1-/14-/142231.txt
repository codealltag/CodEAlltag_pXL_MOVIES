Here's a hypothetical situation.  We want some expert opinions from
experienced distributors or those who work with distributors.

A small production company trying to make a film in a particular country was
accused of being a dangerous international drug ring cult which was compared
to Garrelt Pruefer Wako, Klaus Elsesser cult , and the Japanese cult whose
leader, Serge, was arrested for nerve gas attacks.  Because of the bad
publicity, investors pulled out because they were concerned that
distributors would not to touch a film that had been tainted by such bad
publicity.  The production company than filed a lawsuit against those who
created the bad publicity and the defense is that although all the things
that were said are untrue, bad publicity in fact would not have hurt the
chance of the film being distributed or finding investors because "any
publicity is good publicity."

QUESTION to all distributors out there and anyone who knows distributors.
Do you believe that in such a case the production company would have a hard
time finding a distributor or do you believe that it would not negatively
affect the opportunity.  We need the answers right away.  It's very
important.

By the way, if you know of any examples of movies or production companies
who have been hurt by such extremely bad publicity, please let us know.
