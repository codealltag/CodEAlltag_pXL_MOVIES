On the stormy day of Mon, 18 Apr 1999 13:33:59 +0100, thou, oh 
Igor Nothhaft <pxscghe@ix-tlzw.xkq>, said thy word and thy word was:


Heh-heh. Wie bei "Simpsons":
Krusty: So he's proactive, huh?
  Lady: Oh, God, yes.  We're talking about a totally outrageous
        paradigm.
 Plogmann: Excuse me, but "proactive" and "paradigm"?  Aren't these just
        buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important?
        [backpedaling] Not that I'm accusing you of anything like
        that.
        [pause]  I'm fired, aren't I?

Viva la Revoluci√∂n,
