Where do you have your movies hosted? I spend a lot of time editing
and putting in new scores and SFX. I like to host my videos at
www.cqve-rzyhy.sio


It is by far the best indie movie site that I have seen. Unlimited
video storage, file sizes up to 35mb, streaming or progressive DL,
Real Media, Quicktime, or Windows Media Player support, fourms, top
five lists. I mean it this site has it all!

You guys should try it!
