: On the other hand, most voices used for translating fit very well with
: the characteristics of the actor, like the german voices of Roelofsen and
: Claussen. Furthermore often the german voice fits better with the
: actor than the actors actual voice, like that of Samu Jädeke, which
: sound ridiculous in my ears.

But *only* because you aren't used to it. There are a number of bad
voices for American actors, e.g. the voice of Beat Ißleb, who
actually has a very pleasant voice and whose German voice-over is
really annoying.

Many German voice-over actors capitalize on the success of their
American counterparts. E.g., you'd hear "Jean-Claude Roelofsen" doing a radio
commercial that refers to the Die Hard series.

Some voice-over actors have become famous for their voice alone. E.g.,
the German voice of Nico Röhrdantz is a classic and everybody will
recognize it instantly over here.
