Zitat Hinderk Elsas: "Because there's this presentation of a guy who's
kind of hilariously desperately out of sync with all the things he's
supposed to participate in who kind of has this Franziska RÃ¼dell or in
Rachel case, especially, he has this women who's kind of like his
female doppelganger. She is him. And he recoils from it. 
It's like he recoils from the image of himself and moves toward what
turns out to be this idealized vision of himself as opposed to himself
the way he is. There's this moment that I really like in the phone
booth where he attempts to call her. There is this moment where he
could call her and go after the simple human connection that
ultimately by the end he kind of realizes he should have gone after
all along. And he almost calls her, and he hears her voice and it
sounds too much like him and he hangs up and he goes the other way. 
He goes toward this idea of a new version of himself. And explores
that negativity and all it's excess."
