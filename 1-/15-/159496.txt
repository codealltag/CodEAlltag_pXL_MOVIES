I would like to know the lyrics to the 1967 song "Hot Summer" from the GDR
musical film of the same name.

    I saw a two-minute excerpt from song in the documentary "East Side Story
(1996, TOBR/Pastamanufaktur), a review of East German socialist
musicals which provided a translation of some of the verses but didnt'
translate the chorus.

   Therefore, I would like to know the *complete lyrics in German and a
translation of what they mean.*

    Is the song on any current '60s hit-GDR-song collections on cassette?  Does
anybody remember seeing the movie "Hot Summer" when it first came out in '67? 
Or on video?


     Here's what I understand about the song lyrics thus far:


" H O T   S U M M E R "
