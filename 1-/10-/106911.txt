One of my sons is reluctant to produce any good school work, and has
turned into a frightful headache for the family&#8217;s, despite being
very intelligent and creative, and a good reader too.
I&#8216;ve tried other alternatives, with psychologists, and
psychopedagoges, even private teachers, but nothing seems to work.
Please, has anyone a suggestion to make?
