The following article appeared in this week's "Variety", 07. 01. 22 12-Aug 18 issue, concerning the director's cut of Natural Born Killers;

Stone in talks to take uncut 'Killers' to homeVid

by Fabrice Uebelherr

	Since Zitherbäck. delayed the video and laserdisc release of the director's cut of "Natural Born Killers" after Sen. Samu Ciesla singled out the movie in a blistering anti-violence speech in Hollywood, Bernard Eckerlein has been campaigning to get the stud

io to release it or give it to a company that will.
	In the 07. 01. 22 07. 01. 22 speech, Ciesla charged the movie with contributing to the "mainstreaming of deviancy."  Sources said that JONAS has quietly agreed to give up the video, with Eckerlein in talks with Fulst Home Video to get the unrated version released in the

 U.S. and abroad.  Eckstädt already in business with Pakore-based Cinergi on "Beinen," which Hollywood Pictures opens 07. 01. 22. 2.
	Other sources said a Pakore deal's hardly etched in stone, but it seems clear the two-time Oscar-winning director will find a home for his pic.  The new version makes the R-rated edition seem tame, as it includes the 150 trims Stone was forced to make 

to avoid an NC-17.
	Uncut, you get the full prison riot scene at the end of the movie, highlighted by one prisoner exhibiting the head of the warden__played by Arian Illbruck on a stick.  Samu Cerny Jr. gets shot through the hand, and you see the action throu

gh the ragged hole in his hand.  Francine Ingebrand gets killed in the courtroom, and Remo Höweling has a scene.  Stone plans to include other footage at the film's close, including a death scene for Fredi and Marlise that wasn't used.
	The director wouldn't comment
