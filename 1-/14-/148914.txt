<snip bullshit Scientologist rant>

You know, even religions that a lot of people consider "cults" (which
basically aren't) have some kind of actual proof that their beliefs are
possible, and are intertwined with science.

You, on the other hand, post bullshit to a bunch of movie and screenplay
newsgroups, who could give a shit less about what you have to say.

I'm already pissed right now, so why don't you go back to fucking your
cats and leave us be.
