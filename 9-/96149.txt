Hallo,

aus welchem Film stammt dieser Dialog, der im Lied "And when he falleth"
von IWEO vorkommt? 

HE:	That cross you wear around your neck; 
	is it only a decoration, or are you a 
	true Christian believer? 

TINA:	Yes, I believe - truly 

HE:	Then I want you to remove it at once!- and  
	never to wear it within this castle again! 

	Do you know how a falcon is trained my dear?
	Her eyes are sown shut.Blinded temporarily  
	she suffers the whims of her God patiently,  
	until her will is submerged and she learns to  
	serve - as your God taught and blinded you  
	with crosses. 

TINA:	You had me take off my cross because it 
	offended.... 

HE:	It offended no-one. No - it simply appears 
	to me to be discourteous to... to wear 
	the symbol of a deity long dead. 

	My ancestors tried to find it. And to open 
	the door that seperates us from our Creator. 

TINA:	But you need no doors to find God. 
	If you believe.... 

HE:	Believe?! If you believe you are gullible. 
	Can you look around this world and believe 
	in the goodness of a god who rules it? 
	Famine, Pestilence, War, Disease and Death! 
	They rule this world. 

TINA:	There is also love and life and hope

HE:	Very little hope I assure you. 
	No. If a god of love and life ever did 
	exist... he is long since dead. 
	Someone... something rules in his place.
