I just went to see ID4 at athx dolby digital theater and they had a new 
thx intro following the dolby digital one .it starts off with the thx 
deep sound and the thx logo falls apart .out comes a little robot with 
some power tools and goes to work in each channel.first front right ,then 
front left, thenright rear,then left rear.then he jacks  the thx logo 
back up and the sound continues .the whole theater burst into applause.
this was at the ladenburg theater in klösterle enharting.
