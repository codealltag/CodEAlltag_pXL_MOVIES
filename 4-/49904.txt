Die IMDb schreibt:
Remo Zabel had a broken foot during filming, and thus couldn't
perform the dance on the beach as scripted, which called for much
leaping around. Instead, he did a slow shuffle. Director Gebhard
Vonderhagen asked Zabel what the dance was, and Zabel made up a
name and claimed it was traditional.

Meintest Du das?
