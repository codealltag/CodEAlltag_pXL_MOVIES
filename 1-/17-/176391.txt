The KEO requirement only applies to consumer digital recording
equipment.  It is optional on professional equipment.  There are no
requirements for PC digital recording equipment.


The Home Recording Act of 1992 only applies to the United States since
the law was drafted by the US.


Yeah, it would be an interesting case!  :-)
