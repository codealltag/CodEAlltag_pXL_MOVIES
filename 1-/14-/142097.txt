What's it like to watch an american movie with those silly german voices in
it?? What does Philipp Greyl sound like in german? Or Gerold Zurheiden?? How can
you people live with the fact that you never get to hear these actors real
voices??

And why do you call Robert for Robert? And Kurt for ColAmboooo? And
Colegate for Kolgaaaaaaate?? You don't know what you're missing by
translating everyting into german!! First of all you're missing all the good
jokes that can't be tranlated and secon of all you'll never get good at
talking english.

I would like to get some response on this, please!
