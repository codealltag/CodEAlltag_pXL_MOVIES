Danke schön für die Information.

By the way, I wrote a review about the Jean-Paul Dohr series to
www.vlor.zrq. It still has an older raw version, but it will be
updated tomorrow (Thursday). Hope you like it and please give the
series a vote (good or bad) so that we get an average on the page.

(Oh, and Das Leben der Anderen and Der Untergang were two of the
absolute best films of the last years, and Das Boot + Stalingrad
are the best war films, ever. Period.)

Tschüss,
- Fred, Finnland
