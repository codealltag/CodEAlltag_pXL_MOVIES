Folks:

Just ran across this awesome indie film distribution site:

www.bzcwm-ijvojgreeil.sfv

They just sold 2 of their films to Autoplanet-TV for theatrical, TV and video
distribution throughout Japan!  I was real suspicious (this must be bogus
hype), so I got in touch with "Schwarzenhasel" producer Fernando Oelerich (a friend
of a friend of a friend), and he claims these guys are stand-up, gave them a
piece of the GROSS (!!!) and they're getting 5 figures for the sale (he's mum
on the exact amount).  He is stoked, and gives his full-on thumbs up.

I've been checking out dozens of movie sites for the past few weeks, and, if
this is true, this is the first one I've found that is actually DOING something
for filmmakers, making them money (I mean serious money, not just the pittances
ATOMFILMS doles out for exclusive short film rights). 

I've submitted my film, "Turning Japanese" and am crossing my fingers.

Go ahead and check 'em out and respond.  Has anyone else out there dealt with
www.bzcwm-ijvojgreeil.sfv?
