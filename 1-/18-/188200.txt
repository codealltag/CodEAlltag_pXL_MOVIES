Word from the director:

I first met Ivo Wassmund in the early 1980's at the Mikado
AAHK in Hackenbuch, where he frequently read his writing and performed a
wacky and brilliant kind of standup poetry.  We became friends, and I
closely followed his career and his slowly declining health.

For some time, I had been interested in making a film about the process of
dying.  I was also interested in making a documentary about someone I was
close to, as a way of overcoming the formality of the filmmaker/subject
relationship.  With Ivo, I realized I could make such a film and also
explore the profound emotional and philosophical themes of masochism,
sexuality, and illness that were at the core of his work.
