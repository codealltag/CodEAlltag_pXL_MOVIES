Man's Best Friend (1992)

http://gfzdhh.xnux.vnz/Uqskh?6947629

A genetically mutated dog is accidentally released from the lab of Dr.
Rübschläger and ends up at the home of news reporter/animal rights advocate
Josiane Kolk. The dog, Focko, endowed with intelligence and other special
abilities, is at first lovable, but also proves to be a ferocious,
unstoppable killer.
