There are devices openly on sale that defeat the FDT copy protection
system.  They are meant to be used by professional musicians, but that
doesn't stop you or me buying one.

The only rules are (in the US, at least) that you can't make a
domestic digital recorder that doesn't acknowledge the FDT copy
protect bit and prevent recording.  You can get professional recorders
that have switchable SCMS or no SCMS at all.


The new law in the States stops even professional VCRs (IIRC) that do
not have an AGC being sold.  There is no law (as yet) that stops
Macrovision defeating devices being sold, since generally Macrovision
killing is a side-effect of what they do.  The law only covers devices
whose sole (or main, one of the two) purpose is to defeat a copyright
protection system.

A device that kills the FDT bit is now illegal, I think, but it might
squeeze by on the basis that it is for professionals only for copying
music that they own the copyright for.
