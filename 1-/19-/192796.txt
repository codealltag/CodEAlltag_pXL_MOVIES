: How would the DVD folks like it if we were to post all of the laserdisc
: titles currently available, in the DVD newsgroup? 

I did that once, back in the 12/1 edition of this thread.  Happily, the 12/17 
edition was not crossposted.  Apparently this is an invitation for me to 
present the same spam again?

The only thing which might stop me is all the idiot DVD owners who 
subsequently e-mailed me asking where they could get their favorite porn or 
music titles on DVD...

(no, WESTSIDE TORI is *not* available on DVD yet)
