Hello
I'm From the Netherlands and am a big Jurassic park fan!!
Now I heard that Jp2 will be coming out in the Netherlands on 01. 03. 23
August i was disappointment, but I live near the German Border,
Hontheim near the German village Wespen (wf) I saw too that JP2 releases
in germany on the 01. 03. 23 Juli.
I know you German people like that everything is dubbed or synchronised
or how do I ay that but aren't there any cinemas that show subtitled
movies? 
And so on can you give me your oppinion about all the dubbing in your
Country? I can't immagine you like it?
bye
