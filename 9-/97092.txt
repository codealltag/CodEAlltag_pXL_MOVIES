[MV 48 Film]


Zitat aus der ersten URL:

"MV48 uses a new system to pull the film past the projector bulb
without any jitter or bounce. Hover says he can't go into detail
while his patent is pending, but explains in general terms that MV48
completely eliminates the jiggle that all current films experience as
they dance past the projector bulb. Watching it, I was startled to see
how rock solid the picture was, and how that added to the clarity. "
