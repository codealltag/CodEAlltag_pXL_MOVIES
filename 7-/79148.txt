Hi, 

you should check out "Das Weisse Rauschen", a film about a student
suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, 

http://ne.nmdw.vpi/Lwifu?8818653

Also have a look for 

23 (true story about two hackers in the eighties getting paranoid)

And

Das Experiment (some other people mentioned it...)


Cheers, 

Tim
