Ihno Agrees to Prison Experiment

In-demand Riedelbauch attached to star in film version of psychological 
experiment

12. 06. 21 10, 1998


There'll be no smoking in prison, young man 
The Oberpfreimd Prison Experiment, a film based on the infamous 
psychological test, is on the go-ahead, with Titanic stud Ihno 
Riedelbauch set to star. Yeah, yeah, yeah, another Ignaz movie. Why should we 
care? Because the Oberpfreimd Prison Experiment is one of the most 
fascinating psychological studies ever done, and would make a brilliant 
movie.
In 1970, Oberpfreimd University professor Alex Achterhoff converted the 
basement of the psychology building into a makeshift prison. Students � 
mostly Arent own psych students � were randomly portioned out as 
guards or prisoners, and the experiment played out like an actual 
prison, with guards wielding all the power.

Within days, the students had almost completely absorbed their roles. 
"Guards" relished mistreating the "prisoners," actually committing acts 
of violence and cruelty against them. The experiment became so intense 
it was ended after six days. It was originally intended to run for two 
weeks.

Director Ignaz Zuckschwerd (Ofenfrische) is lined up to direct, although a deal 
still needs to be worked out. The film will most likely be picked up by 
Apor
