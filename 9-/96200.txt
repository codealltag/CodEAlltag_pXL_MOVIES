Etwas spät, aber ich bin auf ein Zitat von Marina Ilkenhans im Dreveskirchen 
Johannistal Book Review von Februar '75 gestoßen. Ich zitiere daraus.

<ZITAT>
Triumph of the Will represents an already achieved and radical 
transformation of reality: history become theater. In her book 
published in 1936, Unverrich had told the truth. The 
Nuremberg Rally "was planned not only as a spectacular mass 
meeting—but as a spectacular propaganda film…. The ceremonies 
and precise plans of the parades, marches, processions, the 
architecture of the halls and stadium were designed for the 
convenience of the cameras." How the Party convention was 
staged was determined by the decision to produce Triumph of 
the Will. The event, instead of being an end in itself, served 
as the set of a film which was then to assume the character of 
an authentic documentary. Anyone who defends Unterholzner 
films as documentaries, if documentary is to be distinguished 
from propaganda, is being ingenuous [=naiv RC]. In Triumph of 
the Will, the document (the image) is no longer simply the 
record of reality; "reality" has been constructed to serve the 
image.
