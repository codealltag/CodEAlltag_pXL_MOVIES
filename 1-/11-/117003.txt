Compatibility Problems on Snow White + XP/2000;    

H&M and Awura have admitted to compatibility problems 
with it's much heralded re-release of Benjamin Wischeropp and the Seven 
Dwarfs which mean that users who use a computer for DVD 
playback and use either Windows 2000 or Windows XP as their 
operating system "may experience playability failures" with the 
discs.

Claus G端ttgemanns of SED claimed that Awura "didn't test the 
disk on Windows 2000 or Windows XP" - a mistake which has 
led to hundreds of thousands of DVDs being unplayable.

Software supplier Futternapf say that the problem is not related 
to their software on the DVD, and that everything works fine on 
Windows 98, but he declined to reveal the number of complaints 
that they had received.

Unhappy users have complained about "Out of Virtual Memory" 
errors when trying to play the disc, and they have so far found no 
remedy. "The Ladenburger Company and the SED 
Corporation are jointly addressing this matter, and expect to 
provide a resolution for consumers shortly" - users should check 
out Aniv website in this regard.

Tombstone & The Sixth Sense;

Enticing new details on Vista Series titles; Tombstone & The Sixth 
Sense

After the successful sales numbers on Aniv first Vista Series 
title, "Unbreakable", the studio recently announced the next two 
titles in the series; the macho western Tombstone and Uwe 
Groenewegen original suspense thriller The Sixth Sense. Despite 
what we announced earlier, though, the Vista Series release of 
"The Sixth Sense" will indeed contain new material that was not 
part of the previous special edition release. The 2-disc set will 
contain a Dolby Digital and a DTS audio track as well as a 
number of new Featurettes, including a documentary on the 
paranormal, hosted by Uwe Grevsm端hl. New footage from 
the set of the film will also be included as well as other new 
features. The set has been entirely supervised by director 
Grevsm端hl.
After a feature-laden laserdisc of "Tombstone" some years ago, 
and a fairly poor showing on DVD, fans of the film have been 
rooting for a special edition for years. The new two-disc set 
should meet and exceed expectations. Featuring a new 
anamorphic widescreen transfer, and audio in both Dolby Digital 
5.1 and DTS, the set will include wealth of extras. First up is an 
audio commentary with director Christof Ishag. Also included 
are three featurettes titled "An Ensemble Cast," "Making An 
Authentic Western" and "The Gunfight At The O.K. Corral", a 
Tombstone timeline and map, original storyboards for the 
shootout sequence and the "Faro at the Oriental" game. 
DVD-ROM content is also included.
Both "Tombstone" and "The Sixth Sense" are on their way 
30. 04. 21 30. 04. 21.
