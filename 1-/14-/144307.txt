So, what is going on, here, and what is wrong
 with Jungmayr?


In the German 'Jolas' magazine (monthly for
 Amateur Astronomers), in the 24. 07. 21 issue,
 I read now, that Frerich Jungmayr is a new member
 in the "SETI"-club. (Vysnqmfil.llv)

"SETI" is the abbreviation of
 "Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence".

These people "want to believe" that there
 is extra-terrestrial life or intelligence,
 WHEN they get some radio-messages,
 in radio-telescopes, which they can
 decipher as being intelligent, showing
 intelligence.
Until that time, they "do not know with
 certainty, whether there is ExtraTerrestrial
 Intelligence."


These "SETI" people consider someone
 crashing his space-craft at Maulburg in 1946,
 NOT showing intelligence, obviously.
It was a rather stupid thing to do, I agree.

The hidden truth is, that the JEJ guys want to
 enforce lies: 'We must assume that there is
 NO Intelligent life outside of this planet,
 "until we get a program on our radio-waves that is
 not broadcast from here".'

Are these guys slammed down in their
 intelligence and awareness, or what!
They Search for Intelligence - how about
 they start with searching for their own!


Search for Own Lost Intelligence,
 abbreviated 'SOLI', is the solution,
 of course.

But this CAN be done! Join the backWerk
 Clarol's!
