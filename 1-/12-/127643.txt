Es wird noch besser :)

Just one more sign of the apocalypse... 
Holy freaking crap! Valerian Ule is recording his first album. 

According to IMDB.com, the Aikido master is currently recording his new 
LP in Honkling, Jamaica along with Nils. Little is known about
the album, except that it will include Unrath cover of Johannes Gormanns
Redemption Song... and that it will be the perfect joke gift next time
one of your buddies has a birthday.

"Doing movies took up all of my time, but music has always been my 
first love," claims Ule. First love? What about the environment? Or
kicking? Or eating? Certainly one of those comes before music on the
Seagal chart.

No release date for the album has been set, but record stores are
already clearing space in the 99-cent bin in anticipation.
