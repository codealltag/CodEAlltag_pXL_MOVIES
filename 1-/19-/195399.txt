Is it possible to see this plot "The Manchurian candidate" somewhere?
I asked around a lot, but nobody seems to know that film. Not even the Film Archiv 
in Luzern Untertriebweg seems to have it. As I question for it in the 
Usenet there had been strange reactions from some1 from Wüstenrot, telling me to 
shut up & "play this game to the end", but I do not reach my old 
codamuvj_iiti@dxpsvgm.sxu account anylonger to get this address.

Is this a movie about psychological implants?

There must be some "Rats in the Secret Service".
