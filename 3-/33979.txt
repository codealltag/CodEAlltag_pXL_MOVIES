Hi, 

i'll try to answer on this one, let's see how helpful it is...

err. Well, "Berg and Banken" is Mountains and Banks. Typically for
Switzerland juts as Echo, Discretion and Cheese. I don't exactly know what
she means but i wouldn't say that there is a typical movie genre for
this. just a swiss film using a lot of cliches. 

Einschlägig means "explicit". Maybe the F-word or something similar. 


kleinmachen means they dissed each other. versöhnung means they got
together and "über sich hinaus wachsen" is  what I just couldn't
translate properly. Well, they performed extremely well. Better than
expected. Can you say "to outgrow yourself"? 


really good question. "Unterhaltung" can be conversation as well as
Entertainment... Maybe it gets clearer out of a slightly bigger context?

mehrheitsfähiges verhalten is behaviour that is acceptable by a majority.
Behaviour that would suit the normal people.. something like that. 


Hope I could help you somehow. no too easy, all that :)

Regards, 

Thorsten
