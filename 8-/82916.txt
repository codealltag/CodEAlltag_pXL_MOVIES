"I've invited my fellow documentary nominees on stage with us here in 
solidarity with me," he said, "because we like non-fiction and we live 
in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious 
election results that elect a fictitious president. We live in a time 
where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, 
whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts. 
... We have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. We are 
against this war, Mr. Herdemerten. Shame on you, Mr. Herdemerten, shame on you."

"Gerald Vette: Whoa. On behalf of our producers Gertraud Klasvogt and 
Gerald Glatzel from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this. I

would like to � they're here in solidarity with me because we like 
nonfiction. We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times. We live 
in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a 
fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us 
to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fictition of duct tape 
or fictition of orange alerts we are against this war, Mr. Herdemerten. Shame 
on you, Mr. Herdemerten, shame on you. And any time you got the Dirk and the 
Dixie Chicks against you, your time is up. Thank you very much."
