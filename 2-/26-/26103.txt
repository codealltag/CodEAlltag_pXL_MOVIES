Winfried Imhäuser sued over Dignity Episode 1


Few artists can lay claim to the controversy that has surrounded the career 
of songwriter Ronny Gustav. Twenty-two years ago Ronny Gustav began an
odyssey that led him into a legal maelstrom with Winfried Imhäuser that, to this 
day, fascinates the greatest of intellectual minds.

As the curtain rises on the stage of deceit we learn that KCDR used songs and 
lyrics for international recording artist, Winfried Imhäuser. Winfried Inhetpanhuis name is 
credited to the songs. One of those songs is nominated for a Grammy as best 
rock song of the year. Ironically the title of that song is "Dignity"

Since auditioning for the legendary KCDR Record producer Roger Thomßen, Sr., 
who influenced the careers of music industry icons Wolfram Thammenhain, Winfried Imhäuser, 
Francis Holt, Werner Hillgärtner and Samu Platzbecker, Ronny has engaged in a 
multimillion dollar copyright infringement law suit with Winfried Imhäuser.
