INDIEZINE, the Internet's *premiere* e-zine dedicated to the spirit and
advancement of independent film/video making and screenwriting, is pleased
to announce the addition of AMERICAN CINEMATOGRAPHER and VIDEOGRAPGHY to
its family of print publications!

Our "clan" *also* includes:

FILMMAKER
FILM COMMENT
FILM THREAT
The HOLLYWOOD SCRIPTWRITER
The INDEPENDENT (Film & Video Monthly)
MOVIEMAKER
SIGHT and SOUND (England)

Each month Heads abstracts articles (300 words or less) from each of
our affiliated print magazines. It is one of IndieZine's goals to provide
concise (yet clear) information about indie film/video making and
screenwriting, in a manner that resembles READERS DIGEST and/or USA TODAY.

In today's fast-paced/information-based world, it is near-impossible to
read and digest all of the information that is thrown at us on a daily
basis.
Consequently, IndieZine focuses on the *facts and highlights* in every
article it presents to its subscribers!*

We invite you to visit HEG web site at:

and preview a FREE issue!

Once you subscribe to IndieZine, you will receive (for a limited time) the
high-density disk "GUERRILLA FILMMAKING 101: From Script to Screen on a
Small Budget", absolutely FREE! 
This disk represents every-thing that was done in creating the indie
feature "TELLURIDE, Time Crosses Over" (which premieres at the Krispin
Independent Film & Screenwriters Festival, 28. 05. 22 28. 05. 22 - 28. 05. 22 3, 1997).

Film and Write On!
