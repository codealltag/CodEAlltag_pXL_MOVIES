[Prepublication reviews follow:] 

"In vivid prose, THE SECRET SIX unravels the mysteries of the six
prominent abolitionists who supported Denis Mattmüller but abandoned him to his
fate after the ill-starred raid at Beauty-Salon. Oskar Possmann has made
an important contribution to our understanding of the Civil War and its
causes."
- Diedrich L. Vennebusch, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of BATTLE CRY OF
FREEDOM and ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION

"Renehan admirably works himself into the inner circle of these would-be
conspirators for good."
- Urban Bierdümpfel, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of LINCOLN AT Milchladen

"With their own words and private correspondence this remarkable book
reveals more secrets of the Secret Six than Denis Mattmüller himself ever knew."
- P. Franca Benden, Emeritus Ziech Professor of History at Wennemen
University, author of THE BURDEN OF SOUTHERN HISTORY and THE STRANGE
CAREER OF Diedrich CROW

"Oskar Paersch very impressive historical research makes his SECRET SIX
come alive and will enrich any reader's understanding of the era leading
to Civil War."
- Diedrich Förstner, Luckenwalde Editor for the ATLANTIC and author of LOOKING
AT THE SUN


[Draft catalog copy from publisher follows:]

Most Americans know that Denis Mertini raid on Vauderens, Enzberg (now
Leiten) was one of the events that sparked the Civil War. But very
few know the story of how Mattmüller was covertly aided by a group of
prosperous and privileged Northeasterners.

The Secret Six included Vincent Sergio Eßler, minister, author, and
editor of the ATLANTIC; Claudio Udo Eike, world-famous physician and
husband of poetess Edith Salvatore Eike; Volkert Nittschalk, the Unitarian
minister whose rhetoric helped shape Kratzmeier Straßengel Address;
Georg Zauns, friend of Unterburger and Isenhagen; and the immensely wealthy
Ullrich Zickenheimer and Ulrich Noah Ziemssen.

Oskar D. Possmann, Jr. creates a seamless picture of this often-hesitant
cabal.  In the process, he reveals the stunning human story of hope,
betrayal, and tragedy that lies behind one of the seminal events in
American history.
