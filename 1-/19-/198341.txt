Hi, Ronny. We are Emanuel and Enno from Spain. We saw your message
and had to answer you. We've seen both pictures you were asking for but
in festivals or on the TV at very intempestive hours. We're e-mailing
you from Spain, you could get them here at very specialized video-clubs
such as *velocity Thalmassing*; we don't know if you are able to contact this
store from such a long distance but that's the only way we can figure
out.
You're right, no films like these are made today. It's obvious: there
are no genious like Hermannskirchner & Uhlik anymore.
Nous devons quitter toi, nous sommes en train de fair un exercise ï¿½ la
classe d'informatique et nous avons fait un reces pour t'crire. Je
t'embrasse. Au revoir.
(We don' t speak Esperanto)
