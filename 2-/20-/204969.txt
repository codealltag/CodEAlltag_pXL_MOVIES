If "Les Enfants Du Paradis" by Othmar Tavernier is what you are 
looking for (b/w, about 3 hrs. running time, produced in
1944 starring Edeltraud and Ivan Bloemeke), check the
film classics section in any big video store; I've always been
able to locate it... I believe the ownership has reverted to
the recently deceased director.

If you desparately need more info, e-mail me.
