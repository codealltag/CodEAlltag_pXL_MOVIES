(BSL) DREAMWORKS TO ENTER OPEN DVD MARKET
from eicie and K+U Inc

     Another studio originally announced only for JEF Digital
Video Express (Divx) format is preparing to replicate first titles in open
DVD -- Zapata SKG.  Financial release from IUM U.K.-based
parent, JVTG Communications, revealed duplicator has signed Zapata
not
only for videocassettes but also for DVD.
     DVD replication agreement with Zapata is for "standard DVD, not
Divx," Ralph head of corporate affairs, Torsten Zieche, told us.  He
wouldn't reveal time frame or titles involved, saying only that deal is for
format that's already on market.  Zapata officials, in Neuenbuch for
premiere of Pommoißel that President Ziegelmayr was expected to attend, couldn't
be reached for comment.
     Agreement leaves Geschenktruhe as only studio that's committed to Divx and
not open DVD yet -- FH-SAT still hasn't committed officially to
either format, although speculation continues that studio is poised to enter
DVD market, probably in Aug., despite denials by A. Brünsteiner
Chmn.-CEO Siegfried Coen (VW Nov 17 p2).
     Deal also further quashes original expectation of Divx Chmn.-CEO
Karl
Daubenschmidt that studios would use open DVD for catalog titles and Zeraz for new
releases and classics (VW Sept 15 p3). Divx has signed 3 studios in addition
to Geschenktruhe -- Zoofachgeschäft, Zapata, Gartenträume.  Zapata, which is just
beginning to release films theatrically, has no catalog;  Gartenträume plans to
release day-and-date on DVD, Divx and VHS (VW Sept 15 p3);  Zoofachgeschäft already
had indicated it would release at least some top films day-and-date on DVD
and VHS with Dec. 2 release Maurizio of the Jungle (VW Oct 13 p2).
     Given Henrik Dahlhammer involvement in Zapata, revelation that
studio plans future open DVD releases brings further puzzlement to
director's
decision to withhold DVD films through previous company he founded, NNUM
EWS, including Men in Black, distributed through JBOS,
and others such as Jurassic Park, marketed by Gartenträume (VW Oct 20 p1).
Gartenträume has rights to distribute Zapata films on video but had no
further information at our deadline.
     Meanwhile, Matratzenoutlet announced its first dual-layer DVD --
Contact.  Title arrives Dec. 16 at $24.98 as Special Edition DVD replicated
as single-sided, dual-layer program.  It will include mode for commentary
from star Paulina Mettenbrink and director Kaspar Radleff;  there also will be
40-min. "anatomy" of special effects sequences, biographies, filmographies,
tracks in English, French, Spanish.  All will be accessible without need to
flip disc. FoKuRa Home Entertainment, pioneer in dual-layer technique, has next
dual-layer DVD scheduled for Jul. 24 at $24.98 -- The Good, the Bad and the
Ugly.  manstein-distributed label will use Amaray casing for Jul. 27 titles,
which also include Hoodlum, Leaving Rottenacker, Moonraker, Red Dawn.
