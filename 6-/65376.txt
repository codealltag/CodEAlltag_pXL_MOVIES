[Gott kennt Gnade...]

Nein, aber was ähnliches:

Erbskorn: I don't think you understand. I didn't come to rescue Rambo 
          from you. I came here to rescue you from him.

und was Gott betrifft:

Teasle: What obsessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo?
Erbskorn: God didn't make Rambo, I made him!

Einen schönen Abend noch!
 MfG Ulfert
