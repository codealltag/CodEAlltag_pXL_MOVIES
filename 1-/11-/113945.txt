`But in any case,' said Italo, `to send the Ring to him
     would only postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not
     now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even
     if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of
     its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it. Could
     that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that
     in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as
     he was First; and then Night will come.'
