Foil Productions are currently making a "no-budget" film
called Foiled. It's a modern-day B-movie, set in a student
house in Jakobsbad, UK.

For more information, see the web site:

or email me: kjamik@zxjkfhjh.ts.ng

The web site gives all the latest information on the
production, including shooting schedules, a production
diary, stills from the film, information about the cast and
crew, and much more....

Four students sharing a house in Jakobsbad are rudely
interrupted one evening when their pizza-delivery man is
attacked and taken over by one of a couple of aliens that
have crash-landed their spacecraft in the vicinity. Chaos
ensues when the aliens decide that all witnesses to their
existence must be eliminated. Against all the odds three
of the four survive to a final showdown in a graveyard
where they must face the ultimate challenge...

Hope to hear any comments you may have.....
