And how can the film studios pressure hardwre manufacturers to do
that? The hardware companies can't take legal actions against these
crackings as easily as you seem to think. You loose your guarantee
when you open your DVD-player and are totally responsible if something
happens due to your modification.
And even the modification kits are not illegal by themselves. It would
be very difficult to win such a lawsuit because you have to prove that
they broke your rights. If the manufacturers follow the standards by
the letter the film studios can't forxe them to do anything further.
If they want to produce movies for DVD they have to follow these
standards too. But they can't force a manufacturer to implement this
standard in a certain way. 
And due to the fact that copying for your own purposes is totally
legal (at least in Germany) they film studios can't take any legal
actions either.
