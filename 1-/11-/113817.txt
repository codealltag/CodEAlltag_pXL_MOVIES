Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a
     long shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the
     arrow slipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and
     fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs of stone,
     and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire. But it
     was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror. The ranks
     of the orcs had opened, and they crowded away, as if they
     themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What
     it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the
     middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater;
     and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it.

     It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud
     had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the
     fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it;
     and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled,
     and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a
     stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many
     thongs.

     'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! '

     Gimli stared with wide eyes. `Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and
     letting his axe fall he covered his face.

     'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf. `Now I understand.' He faltered and
     leaned heavily on his staff. `What an evil fortune! And I am
     already weary.'
