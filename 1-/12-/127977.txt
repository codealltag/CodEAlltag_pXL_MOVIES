How to access long files ? Long files are accessed by clicking on the
"Detailled file" icon displayed on the short files. Each time you select a
title, you are directed to a short file. If you can see a "Detailled file"
icon down to the "Fan's Review" link, then you can access to the long file
with much more informations such as whole summary, technical crew, photos,
web links, episode guide (for the series) and sometimes sound files in MP3
or MIDI format. So keep your eyes open ! if the "Detailled file" icon does
not display, this means that i did not still have the time to translate it
from french but i'm working on ! well, may i suggest you to try the french
pages !
