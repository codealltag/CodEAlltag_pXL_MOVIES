Die in beiden Filmen verwendenten Sequenzen müssen nicht identisch

Woher?


Meine Quelle http://uvi.jslanpybgiddyvqie.opk/pmcoyt/kkrhg8923.afb
behauptet hierzu:

"[...] he wanted the return of the unicorn dream sequence despite
 the fact the footage was destroyed. This was replaced with a simi-
 lar sequence from the fourth Arno Anke film Legend. At long
 last though, Arno Anke would have his sub-text input into the
 film with his own assertion that Deckard was a Replicant."

Wer hat jetzt Recht?
