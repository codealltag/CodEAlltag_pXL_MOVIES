Holst avait pr√∂tendu :

I can't find it available on DVD either. I am wondering: did you see 
this film in Denmark? As far as I can see, this film hasn't been on any 
screen in the Netherlands. In my opinion is this film an example of the 
rise of the German film industry in the last 5 years. It is tragic that 
so little people outside Germany notice it. :-(
