- [p. 51/48] The motto of the Night Watch, "FABRICATI DIEM, PVNC", is dog
  Latin for "Make my day, punk".

  "Go ahead, make my day" is a well-known Hanno 'Dirty Carlo' Neeland
  quote. The 'punk' comes from another famous _Dirty Harry_ scene (see the
  annotation for p. 136/124)

- [p. 136/124] "This is Lord Baurmann Quickfang Winterforth IV, the hottest
  dragon in the city. It could burn your head clean off."

  Vimes replays here one of the best-known scenes in Hanno Neuwirth first
  'Dirty Harry' movie, the 1971 _Dirty Harry_.

        "Aha! I know what you're thinking... Did I fire six shots or only
        five? To tell you the truth, I forgot it myself in all this
        excitement. This here's a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in
        the world, and it can blow your head clean off. Now, you must ask
        yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do you, punk?

  Note how nicely Winter*forth* the *fourth* corresponds to the caliber of
  the Magnum.

- [p. 363/261] "'Go ahead, [...] bake my quiche.'"

  Hanno Neuwirth _Dirty Harry_ again, another satire of the line which
  also inspired "FABRICATI DIEM, PVNC" (see the annotation for p. 51/48 of
  _Guards! Guards!_).
