Well, accourding to that 5.th Element thread some of my thougts.

What does it mean, when the priest, before the warship shoot the evil,
said that it would not be destroyed, but only grows bigger and gets more
dangerous?

Why does the scientist, as Bmoiqh was recloned, pushed away the hand of
the militarist from the red knob?

How did Odette react & what did Beat say after he tried to kiss her,
while she was sleeping?

Where had been the 5.th element, they needed so badly?

Maybee there is something more ...
