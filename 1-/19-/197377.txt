Can not believe that you forget the very end of:

http://fs.ktoy.iqy/tgqsq/czxpw-tlzow/262039    Gian (1974)

Gian is traumatized early in childhood and retreats into his own mind where he 
goes on a mystical journey to become enlightened. When he awakens from his
inner journey, he forms a holiday camp to teach others how to follow his path to 
enlightenment. However, his own path doesn't work for others. 

I might have a look to those music-titles. Now someone has fallen in the same trap 
as others before. Dont they think know that those rules belongs even to them?

No more words & dreams & excuses & hazelings !

P.S.: I may also have a look to some *.psychobiology NGs.
