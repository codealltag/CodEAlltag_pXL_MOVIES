Das wird er im Film auch. Evtl. nicht in der Kinofassung, aber in der
DVD Fassung. Da lautet der Text

"...and every day was a life age of the Earth. But it was not the
End. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back, until my task is
done."


Im Buch: 

    'Naked I was sent back -- for a brief time, until my task is
    done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was
    crumbled into dust, the window gone; the ruined stair was choked
    with burned and broken stone. I was alone, forgotten, without
    escape upon the hard horn of the world. There I lay staring
    upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as
    a life-age of the earth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour
    of all lands: the springing and the dying, the song and the
    weeping, and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone. And
    so at the last Gwaihir the Windlord found me again, and he took me
    up and bore me away.
