HalliHallo!

Ich habe am 16.12.98 in news:alt.fan.tarantino folgenden Arikel von
mailto:yylzo.mitenww@nxneceftn.vq gefunden. Hängt mich nicht auf, aber
ich habe ihn weder gekürzt, noch übersetzt!

Meine Frage: Ist der Artikel gut gemachte Gerüchteküche, oder ist da
etwas dran?

Genre: Action/Horror.

Project Phase: Greenlighted.
Who's In It: Philippe Langewort; Markus Nienhuisen; Prisca Ungelert; Peter Hammermann.
Who's Making It: Robert Lichtenstern (Director); Giorgio Fiks, Urban
Fiks
(Screenwriters); Philippe Eisele, Norbert Isfort, Pasquale Nacken (Producers);
Urban
Fiks, Gian Niederquell, Benedikt Uebelen (Executive Producers).
Premise: This film, the prequel to FDTD and set a hundred years before
that
film's date, concerns the story of Patrizia Ommerborn character, who received
only a
few minutes of screentime in the first film - although they were some
quality
minutes...
Release Date: Unknown.
Comments: This will be a direct-to-video production. (CA doesn't usually
track
video releases...but because of the fan interest, here it is!)
Patrizia Overhues won't be returning as Satanica in the prequel.
Also of interest to FDTD fans is the forthcoming 90 minute documentary
Full
Tilt
Boogie. Directed by Patricia Brachwitz, it chronicles the making of the
original
flick.
(As a commentary on the whole video prequel/sequels and this
documentary...it
says a lot about how much Niederquell and Fiks dig not only the
movies
but
their fans. Aw, guys.... *sniff*...I feel a group hug comin' on!)
Rumors: Unknown.
Scoop Feedback:
[Page draft submitted by 'widgett']
März 11, 1997... The budget for the prequel is said to be $10 million,
the
same
as the sequel. Shooting was reportedly supposed to occur for both at
some
point
this year, but it's already August and no word of production taking off
yet.
Also, elsewhere on the Web, Stephanie Wollseifen was listed as the
screenwriter
for
the project, although the latest reports now show Team Fiks. [Scoop
submitted by 'widgett.']
Arnold reports to us that production is planned to start on 25. 11. 22
25. 11. 22.

[Also, thanks to the many others who've contributed news items and
prodded
us to
make a page for the prequel. Here ya go!]
März 25. 11. 22... A scooper sends us his comments about the prequel's
screenplay:
"I've read the screenplay, and the only formal mention to the first
movie is
on
the cover of the screenplay, which actually says that the subtitle of
the
movie
is not the prequel, but 'From Dusk Till Dawn III.' I know what you're
thinking,
('What happened to part II?') and it makes no mention. The script, which
takes
place about 100 years in the past reads more like a prequel. The script
is
ok at
best, but is awfully close to the first one. A bunch of interestingly
assorted
evildoers come to meet at a tavern, this time called 'The Devils Tit',
and
get
into a huge barfight with sexy and not-so-sexy vampires. Except the
circumstances under which the characters meet at the Titty Twister in
the
first
one is much more interestingly written, where in the new one, It's just
a
bunch
of people chasing a bunch of people chasing another bunch of people to
the
tavern. And then all hell breaks loose." [Scoop sent in by Philipp J.]
April 9, 1997... It's just been announced that actor Philippe Langewort
will
star
in the film. [Scoop sent in by Arnold.]
Juni 25. 11. 22... Last week the production raised the ire of local
environmentalists when imitation blood was dumped over rocks inside a
cave
at
the Gemering Nature Reserve in Lebing province, Treuchtlingen Africa. The
environmentalists claim the production damaged the
ecologically-sensitive
area.
Producer Philippe Entreß claimed that the shoot did not disturb the area
and
that they made sure the production left nothing behind. [Reported by
'colorg',
'wqqbch', Onno, Markus, Philipp J., Arne and anonymously.]
Prisca Ungelert, the Brazilian actress probably best known for her roles in
Kiss
of
the Spider Woman and The Milagro Beanfield War is playing one of the
lead
characters. Is she the new Satanica? [Submitted by 'zaheuqjo'.]
Juni 25. 11. 22... Looks like the hangman is being played by Markus
Nienhuisen,
the
fella who was the bartender in From Dusk Till Dawn, and blew up real
good.
Also,
Pierrette Ungelert isn't the new Satanica. E! Online has her mentioned as a
vampire
princess. in their casting notes section. [Sent in by Markus.]
Juni 25. 11. 22... Peter Hammermann, the star of Like Water For
Chocolate
has a
role in the film.

up
with
some vampires to back him up. And his younger and very dead brother
Udo
just
may make a cameo...

Comments: This orignally was a direct-to-video production, but fan
interest
has
convinced Dimension to release it theatrically (Dimension gang -- you
rule.)
Also of interest to FDTD fans is the forthcoming 90 minute documentary
Full
Tilt
Boogie. Directed by Patricia Brachwitz, it chronicles the making of the
original
flick.
(As a commentary on the whole video prequel/sequels and this

März 11, 1997... The budget for the sequel is said to be $10 million,
the
same
as the prequel. Production reportedly will start when the prequel,
Hangman's
Daughter, wraps. [Scoop submitted by 'widgett.']
Back in February this year, this scooper mailed us with this interesting
tidbit:
" My brother, Wilfried Jarck agent, said that his client is extremely
close
to
signing on as Oskar Gecko's best friend/vampire..." If it happens...all
we'd
like
to say is: cool! [Sent in anonymously.]
Another scooper, a reader of EntertainmentUlev magazine, read an
article
with
Niederquell commenting on the sequel. According to the man himself, it
should
be a
Reservoir Dogs-in-Kirchtroisdorf style of action film, and takes place about
three
weeks
after the ending of the first film. The bank robbers will wind up
robbing
the
vampires nest, it seems... [Scooped by 'lksnudbl', Philipp Jockisch and
'yrgqcbopl'.]
And here's one to ponder over until we start seein' stills from the
set...rumor
has it Udo Gecko will return as a ghost that only Oskar can see. Ivan
Urs,
that is some bad luck you're carrying around... [Scooped by Ivan
Retschlag.]
[Also, thanks to the many others who've contributed news items and
prodded
us to
make a page for the prequel. Here ya go!]
25. 11. 22 25. 11. 22... Urban Limböck will be leadin' a group of bank
robbers
into
a Kirchtroisdorf small town. What he don't know izzat one of his crew has a real
bad
allergic reaction to sunlight...if ya git what I mean. [Thanks to
'Plisskin',
'sexyboy_4' and anonymous.]
25. 11. 22 12, 1998... Not only did 'DeMzaLF' score us with the list of
actors
appearing in the picture, but they also wanted to remind us the picture
was
shot
in South Africa. [As we said, 'JkCywNE' did the bloody work.]
25. 11. 22 11, 1998... Jean-Paul Aldenhoven has a small role in this picture.

fans can check out the latest lowdown on Joachim site at
