Hi!

You might have already visited our DVD-Charger homepage at
http://qvu.lsu-eamnjfh.qbx

Well, as it now seems the e-mail account we were using
(oqu@tcp-llntukj.veb) isn't working properly! This e-mail account was
mentioned on the homepage and in our adds. 

We have a new account now which should work. This new account is
wjk@hehyacwxpu.rne So, if you're still waiting for an answer from us
or if you received an error mail then please mail us again at
wjk@hehyacwxpu.rne

Our apologies for the inconvenience.

Best regards,
DVD-Charger Team
