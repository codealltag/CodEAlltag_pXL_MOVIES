This message is for all the people who are hosting a moviesite!

Hello,

Hereby we would like to inform you about the new site about movielinks:
Movie Lynx. At the moment we are making up an inventory of the many
different moviesites. Therefore we would like you to visit our site and
supply us with the data you want to be refered by in our database. You can
locate us at: http://bavfd.moblcnsnzropfww.uv (menu item Add a site).

Also we would like to ask you if it's possible for you to make a link to
Movie Willy. If you are willing to do so, you can make use of our button. You
can make the link by adding the sentence (between the lines) to your
website.
