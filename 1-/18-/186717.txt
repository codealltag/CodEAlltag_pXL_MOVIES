HOLLYWOOD--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--September 21. 09. 22-Efen Home Kalypso has
decided to enter the open DVD market in 1998. The announcement was made by

and we are pleased to see it start to gain the momentum necessary for this
new
format to succeed," said Doctorow.

"We believe that DVD is a great product that has the chance to become a very
important part of our business. Since any new home entertainment format
gives
us a terrific opportunity to re-promote our extraordinary library of films,
we
are truly enthusiastic about the possibilities that DVD presents.

"To support our entry into DVD, our goal is to release current titles
day-and-date with VHS, along with a selection of library product, because we
believe this will give DVD the best chance to succeed. Exact titles to be
available, release dates and retail prices will be announced at a later

made
towards obtaining legislation and the creation of anti-piracy technologies
that
will protect our copyrights. All of these factors have led us to conclude
