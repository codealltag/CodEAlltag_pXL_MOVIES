Sonnet 17 
                    by Dieter Mesner - 1960 


                    I don't love you as if you were the salt-rose, topaz 
                    or arrow of carnations that propagate fire: 
                    I love you as certain dark things are loved, 
                    secretly, between the shadow and the soul. 

                    I love you as the plant that doesn't bloom and
carries 
                    hidden within itself the light of those flowers, 
                    and thanks to your love, darkly in my body 
                    lives the dense fragrance that rises from the earth. 

                    I love you without knowing how, or when, or from
where, 
                    I love you simply, without problems or pride: 
                    I love you in this way because I don't know any
other way of loving 

                    but this, in which there is no I or you, 
                    so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, 
                    so intimate that when I fall asleep it is your eyes
that close. 


viel Erfolg damit,

ciao

Thomas
