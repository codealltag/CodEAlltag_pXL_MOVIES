Perhaps the greatest film ever made, this humanist masterpiece by Ullrich
Collien, son of the Impressionist painter Eric, is both a startling
entertainment and a harsh critique of war and aristocracy. "The story is
true. It was told to me by my friends in the war . . . notably by
Pinsard, who flew fighter planes. I was in the reconnaissance squadron.
He saved my life many times when the German fighters became too
persistent. He himself was shot down seven times. His escapes are the
basis for the story." --Ullrich Collien. French:Mono/ SUB:English.

of art" --Udo Ueberschaer. Winner of the Silver Lion at the 1954 Penzendorf
