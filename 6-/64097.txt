[Mystic River]

*SPOILER*


Der läuft hier leider nicht...


Dafür habe ich http://dxk.cljtuh.mxs/hqvntq/Jowcua_Mtmh/EA44Fj94.lkux
gelesen. Dort heißt es (der Autor kennt nur Buch, nicht Film)

But like Sven hunchback story, Mystic River is not tragic, it is
merely grotesque. (Full disclosure: I have not had access to the film,
but read the Henry Terbach novel whence it is derived). Young boys
murder the daughter of a hoodlum for a lark. Within minutes, and close
by, a childhood friend of the hoodlum murders a sexual predator whom
he has encountered by pure chance, prompted by memory of molestation
suffered as a boy. The hoodlum mistakenly concludes that his childhood
friend is the murderer of his daughter, and murders him in turn.
Distasteful and somewhat depraved, Mystic River nonetheless is comedy,
based on random events and mistaken identities. Do not look for
strategic judgment where this sort of concoction passes universally
for tragedy.

übrigens ein Text über Politik, aber das nur am Rande.
