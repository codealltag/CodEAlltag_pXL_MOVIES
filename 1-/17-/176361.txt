That may be true, but it still doesn't make it legally (and possibly
ethically) right.  If I were to openly sell a product which defeats the
PDA copy protection on digital recording equipment, then I would be
breaking the law (specifically, the Home Recording Act of 1993).  There
may be legal protection on the technology which prevents analog
duplication (i.e. Macrovision, etc.) which does not allow the consumer
to bypass said technology.

Don't get me wrong, I do NOT like Macrovision.  It can be disruptive to
the video quality.  And since I don't even have a VCR to copy laserdiscs
and/or DVDs, I shouldn't have to put up with it.  My whole point here
was that I'm surprised the DVD hardware/software manufacturers haven't
tried to legally stop the various companies (on the Net, etc.) that sell
kits to defeat their various protection schemes.  Especially since these
compaines have been flaunting their cracks for quite some time now!
