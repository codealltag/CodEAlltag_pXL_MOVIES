I have work in audio production for 10 of my 28 years. I have done many
corporate audio projects, but my goal is film. I believe my work is very
creative, powerful and professional. I do not pretend to have the gear or
talent as my influences... however, I am beyond a "starting point" in my
work. I will submitt demos of my music to any party intrested. Please keep in
mind that I am only in search of serious, professional film makers.
I DO NOT work on points or for free. If you respond via EMail, please give
information 
about your company or film project. Please take note of my influences..
MY WORK IS BEST FOR DRAMA !!!
