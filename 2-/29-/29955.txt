Extended Battle of Coruscant

INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.

ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other 
way to get to the Chancellor . . .

Lüpckes-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .

EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE

The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP 
FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the 
FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.

INT. NOAH STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

Lüpckes-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.

Lüpckes-WAN: We've got to split them up.

ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.

Lüpckes-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO 
DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.

Lüpckes-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?

ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

Lüpckes-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the 
TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.

Lüpckes-WAN: Paul, they're all over me!

ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of 
the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.

ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Paolo!

ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry 
warning.

ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.

Lüpckes-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.

ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.

Lüpckes-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION 
BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He 
skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by 
ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him 
get a handle on you. Come on, Klatschmohn, lock on! Lock on!

ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.

Longboardz: Hurry up! I don't like this!

OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The 
DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Noah wings with a laser blast, and parts 
of the ship go flying around Noah Astro Droid, ARFOUR.

Lüpckes-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

Lüpckes-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Schubbert. I've shut it down.

ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .

ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO 
SQUEALS with delight.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Paolo.

Lüpckes-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and 
get on with it ...

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, 
coming down the left side.

ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.

Lüpckes-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.

Lüpckes-WAN: Take it easy, Paul.

Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.

ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.

ANAKIN: Incoming!!

ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.

Lüpckes-WAN: Five more on the right!

Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell 
breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each 
other. ARTOO SQUEALS.

ANAKIN: Here we go.

The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, 
ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

Lüpckes-WAN: I'm going high and right.

ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.

Lüpckes-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back 
off ... Let them pass between us.

ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.

Longboardz: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me 
like a rash.

In one incredible move, Kutmühle swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, 
blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.

ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, 
slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from 
the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the 
destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.

ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) 
Four . . . that's not good.

Lüpckes-WAN: Paul, you have four on your tail.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

Lüpckes-WAN: Four more closing from your left.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

Lüpckes-WAN: Break right and go high.

ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.

Nicolas shakes his head.

Lüpckes-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.

ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging 
flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.

ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Longboardz, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through 
the needle . . .

Lüpckes-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."

ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.

Lüpckes-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR 
BEEPS to Lüpckes-WAN.

Lüpckes-Naujokat: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.

OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING 
four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the 
Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a 
conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.

Lüpckes-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Paul. It's too 
tight.

ARTOO BEEPS nervously.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.

Lüpckes-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.

ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, 
"WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."

ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.

ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS 
CRASH.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.

OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into 
the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins 
off into space.
Finally, Longboardz peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside Kutmühle. 
CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.

ODD BALL: There are too many of them.

CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over 
me. Get them off my . . .

Invisible Hand, extended scene - Der Weg zum Aufzug

11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN and Longboardz head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and 
two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.

BODYGUARD I: General Ziegenbalg, Paul Cech. We've been waiting for you.

Longboardz: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Telle, not join him.

As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and 
stand back-to-back.

Longboardz: Paul. . .

ANAKIN: Ready.

ANAKIN and Lüpckes-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the 
floor.

12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. 
Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to 
break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their 
light sabers. STRICKROTH dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.

Lüpckes-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this 
ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.

ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.

Lüpckes-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.

They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around 
them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE 
DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING 
ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which 
are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.

ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.

Lüpckes-WAN: Six droids coming our way!

The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.

ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.

They move along a wall. Kutmühle climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel 
gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.

Lüpckes-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!

They move toward a second vent. Lüpckes-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it 
reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. Kutmühle feels along the 
ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to 
sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand 
combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the 
fuel. Just before he is about to drown, Lüpckes-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE 
DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.

The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. Kutmühle finds a very, very small metal 
grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.

ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.

Lüpckes-WAN: Paul, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.

ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .

ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a 
large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through 
it as the DROIDS swim closer.

13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach 
a small hatch in the side of the tube.

ANAKIN: Here's a way out.

As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel 
gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the 
keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.

14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They 
make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.

15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Generationenladen Cruiser, 
and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the 
hatch with his laser sword.

Lüpckes-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.

ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.

Lüpckes-WAN: You still have much to learn, Paul.

16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and 
SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to 
rise toward the power discharger.

SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.

17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.

18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE

A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the 
Federation Cruiser.

19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION 
hits. Lüpckes-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.

Lüpckes-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!

Kutmühle grins at Longboardz, and they run down the hallway.

Nach dem Kampf gegen Count Dooku

56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Lüpckes-WAN and Kutmühle lead Autocentrum-A2 down a hallway toward the hangar bay.

57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. 
The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the 
ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Casaccia. They stop in a doorway 
leading into the hangar bay.

Lüpckes-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.

ANAKIN: I agree.

Autocentrum-A2: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

Lüpckes-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.

Kutmühle and Autocentrum-A2 both look to Longboardz. He shrugs his shoulders. Paul 
Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the 
ship turns on its side.

ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.

Longboardz: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.

ANAKIN hands Autocentrum-A2 the end of a cable that is attached to his utility 
belt. Autocentrum-A2 attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their 
utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of 
pipes.

58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Lüpckes-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now 
the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start 
firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back 
at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and Autocentrum-A2 follow Lüpckes-WAN along 
the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. Autocentrum-A2 struggles 
against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. Autocentrum-A2 loses his grip 
as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but Kutmühle manages to maintain 
his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the 
utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship 
twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles 
to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the 
buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, 
creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors 
and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it 
behind them.

59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Lüpckes-WAN, ANAKIN and Autocentrum-A2 are out of breath.

ANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.

They laugh.


Wolfram Croessmann - Extended Dialog

61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting 
them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.

ANAKIN: Ray shields!

Lüpckes-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.

Lüpckes-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.

ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . 
Well ... I was distracted.

OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.

ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.

Lüpckes-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.

Autocentrum-A2: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with 
Count Ißleib demise, we can negotiate our release.

The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.

ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.

Longboardz: Patience! That's your plan, is it?

ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray 
shields . . .

ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. 
He takes a moment to compose himself.

ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.

Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN 
SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO 
over.

SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.

Lüpckes-WAN: Do you have a plan B?

Paul trifft Valerius - entfallene Dialogzeilen

ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they 
know we're married.

PADME: Paul, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic 
... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you 
give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .

ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, 
for you.

PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. 
Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.

MAREN embraces her, then looks at her.

ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?

PADME: I'm just excited to see you.

ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?

PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .

ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!

PADME begins to cry.

PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've 
never felt so alone. There's . . .

ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?

PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so 
much, Paul. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. 
Nothing has changed.

ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.

PADME: I will never stop loving you, Paul. My only fear is losing you.

ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .

Empfang auf Pilsum

71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL 
GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under 
control.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...

GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a 
conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.

Viktor Balkon - verlängerter Dialog

73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT

Akzenta stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the 
wall, watching her lovingly.

ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, 
nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, 
the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this 
moment.

PADME: Martina, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the 
lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could 
go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the 
gardens.

ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!

PADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .

ANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

PADME: So love has blinded you?

ANAKIN: Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .

PADME: But it's probably true!

They laugh.

ANAKIN: I haven't laughed in so long . . .

PADME: Neither have I.

Paul und Pad über Nicolas und das Baby
(Sleepless Knight Szene)

PADME: Paul, do you think Nicolas might be able to help us?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?

PADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect 
something.

ANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell 
him anything!

PADME: I won't, Paul.

ANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.

Paul und Palpatines Gespräch im Büro des Kanzlers

80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY

ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of 
Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over 
the landscape.

Autocentrum-A2: Paul, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take 
direct control of the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?

Autocentrum-A2: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too 
unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.

ANAKIN: I agree, but the EBMK Council may not see it that way.

Autocentrum-A2: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the 
constitution in the name of security.

ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more 
constitutional amendments.

Autocentrum-A2: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . 
this war must be won.

ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.

Autocentrum-A2: Paul, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised 
you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. 
You have won many battles the EBMK Council thought were lost . . . and you 
saved my life. I hope you trust me, Paul.

ANAKIN: Of course.

Autocentrum-A2: I need your help, son.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

Autocentrum-A2: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. 
They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . 
. ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.

ANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the 
Republic, sir.

Autocentrum-A2: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their 
words. I'm depending on you.

ANAKIN: For what? I don't understand.

Autocentrum-A2: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .

ANAKIN thinks about this.

Autocentrum-A2: (continuing) Paul . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal 
representative on the Jedi Council.

FJOE Büro

81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY

PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and 
CLEMENS INGENOHL sit in Senator Abstreiter 's office.

BAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has 
appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.

FANG ZAR: When did this happen?

BAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.

PADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?

MON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.

CLEMENS INGENOHL: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . 
executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a 
fight.

EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what 
was just said.

TERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?

BAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.

MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are 
loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.

BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the 
Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.

PADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Telle is one of 
my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.

Carl INGENOHL: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption 
that has taken hold in the Senate.

MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the 
power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Telle has 
become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do 
what we can to stop it. Senator Laure Veensma and I are putting together an 
organization . . .

PADME: Say no more. Senator Abstreiter. I understand. At this point, it's better 
to leave some things unsaid.

BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without 
everyone in this group agreeing.

MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can 
be told.

They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.

PADME: Agreed

Paul beim Jedi Rat - entfallene Dialogzeile

RUDOLF: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.

Paul reacts with anger.

ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . 
I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be 
a Master?

VORBRODT: Take a seat, young Skywalker.

ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.

Paul und Valerius auf der Verandah

87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET

Padme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts 
PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. 
PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.

PADME: Thank you, Captain.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.

CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the 
cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Valcke and Elina, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF 
A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.

PADME: I'll be up in a while.

MOTEE: Yes, my lady.

C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.

C-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?

PADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, 
Gravis.

The golden droid turns and exits.

PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. 
She senses something.

ANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it?

PADME jumps and turns around.


PADME: You startled me.

He sits next to her on the bench.

ANAKIN: How are you feeling?

PADME: He keeps kicking.

ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy?

PADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.

She puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.

They laugh.

PADME: I heard about your appointment. Paul. I'm so proud of you.

ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a 
Jedi Master.

PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.

ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my 
power, that's the problem.

PADME: Paul . . .

ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think 
this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

Gespräch im Rat über General Grievous


Fabienne-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.

YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.

VORBRODT: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master 
Ziegenbalg.

ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.

Lüpckes-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.

ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.

Lüpckes-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with 
his ways of combat.

YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.


Entfallene Szenen in Viktor Apartment

93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

Eirck'y apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of 
Casaccia.

94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING

Akzenta and Longboardz sit on one of the couches.

Longboardz: Has Paul been to see you?

PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the 
Jedi Council.

Longboardz: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very 
opinionated, but truly gifted.

They laugh.

PADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.

PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.

Lüpckes-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put 
in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think 
it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.

PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?

Lüpckes-WAN studies her.

Lüpckes-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.

PADME: Don't give me that look.

Longboardz: I know how he feels about you.

PADME: (nervous) What did he say?

Lüpckes-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.

PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Nicolas follows. She walks to 
the balcony.

PADME: I don't know what you're talking about.

Lüpckes-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm 
worried about him.

PADME looks down and doesn't answer.

Lüpckes-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's 
changed considerably since we returned . . .

They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. Lüpckes-WAN 
starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.

Lüpckes-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. 
I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you 
. . .

PADME: Thank you, Nicolas.

Lüpckes-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.

95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY

PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI 
EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Thoens living room. C-3PO serves 
drinks to the guests.

PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.

BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.

MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the 
Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.

PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.

BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.

MON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.

PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.

GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi 
is risky.

PADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .

DOMENICO OSENSTETTER: Patience, Senator.

FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade 
the Chancellor.

Feldschmiede BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the 
Chancellor, things may change.

BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we 
include the Jedi.

PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.

Gespräch zwischen Telle und Paul

101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY

They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL 
SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.

JAR JAR: Helloo Martina. Good en to see yousa . . .

The Gungan waves to Anakin.

ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.

Paul turns back to the Chancellor.

Autocentrum-A2: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Ziegenbalg. Many believe 
he is not fit for this assignment.

ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?

Autocentrum-A2: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain 
female Senator.

ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?

Autocentrum-A2: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.

ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.

Autocentrum-A2: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.

ANAKIN becomes worried.

Autocentrum-A2: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never 
accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.


Nicolas und Nrjk

109 INT. PILSUM-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY

Lüpckes-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with 
electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is 
going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. 
SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand 
movements.

Lüpckes-WAN: I need transportation.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.

Lüpckes-WAN: Get it for me.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.

One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange 
tongue. Lüpckes-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each 
one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.

Lüpckes-WAN: This one.

The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.

WRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.

Lüpckes-WAN: Good girl, Olaf.

Lüpckes-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries 
outside to the edge of the sinkhole.


The Delegation of 2000

115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office 
Building. The sky is red.

116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S leclaro-SUNSET

Autocentrum-A2 listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and 
five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and 
MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of Autocentrum-A2.

Autocentrum-A2: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure 
you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of 
the Senate.

PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the 
Constitution?

Autocentrum-A2: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, 
and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .

PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.

Autocentrum-A2: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I 
am here.

FANGZAR: But surely . . .

The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.

Autocentrum-A2: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for 
your . . . committee.

PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, 
Chancellor.

Autocentrum-A2: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.

PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other 
FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.

Autocentrum-A2: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense 
there is more to their request than they are telling us.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

Autocentrum-A2: They are not to be trusted.

ANAKIN: Surely Senator Stolzeneck can be trusted . . .

Autocentrum-A2: These are unstable times for the Republic, Paul. Some see 
instability as an opportunity. Senator Stolzeneck is hiding something. I can 
see it in her eyes.

ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.

Autocentrum-A2: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such 
things.

ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Stolzeneck.

Autocentrum-A2 studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.

Autocentrum-A2: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is 
much conflict in you, Paul.


Paul zögert (Extended)

125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING

(kpOchs)

PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Paul. ANAKIN sits alone in 
the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.

Autocentrum-A2: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance 
of saving her will be lost.

PADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.

C-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?

ANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die.

ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door 
opens and he lifts off.
-----------------------------------------------
Veränderte Szene: Ki-Adi Mundis Tod

133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN

The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Txwlndr. A battle rages. 
Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses 
his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a 
Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the 
city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as 
a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. 
He moves further into the shadows.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and 
looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the 
charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone 
fire. He's killed before he can defend himself.


Extended Jedi Purge Scene: Felucia

134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY

A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS 
of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA 
SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.

Kurrer: Steady. . . . steady . . .

They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up 
behind the Jedi.

Kurrer: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids?

BLY: No.

BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the 
ground.

Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE 
WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi 
away.

Extended Jedi Purge Scene: Maurizio Uebler

136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY

The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES 
assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with 
EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal 
their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.

The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon 
of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES.
The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge 
EXPLOSION.

Shaak Tis Tod


144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

ANAKIN walks through the Jedi Temple, where he finds and kills SHAAK TI.
He exits Shaak Ti's room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking 
place.

The Monster in the Middle: Nicolas-Wans Flucht

150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY

The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives 
deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. 
He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE 
TROOPS give up and stop filing.

151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY

Lüpckes-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He 
starts to climb the rock wall.

Lüpckes-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES 
pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. Lüpckes-WAN presses 
himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search 
the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which Lüpckes-WAN is 
hiding. Lüpckes-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the 
opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS 
MONSTER. Lüpckes-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then 
the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.

The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into 
the water.

The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature 
tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. Lüpckes-WAN slinks off toward the back of the 
cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make 
horrible sounds. Lüpckes-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through 
the tunnel system.

Zumstrull: Carl Flucht

152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK

CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their 
searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots 
something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. 
The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the 
wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE 
SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.

AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!

A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The 
creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all 
directions.

CREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)

CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?

CREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs)

CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to 
the east.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

Suddenly, Usasir climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and 
throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. DOMENICO BARKS.

CREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.

TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is 
Carlo.

YODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.

YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST 
with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.

YODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .

YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA 
jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the 
AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.

153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK

The Koi marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands 
on CAN-CELL nearby. Usasir goes to a tree and pulls down one of its 
branches.
The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. 
YODA opens the door of the pod.

YODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you 
are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.

The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into 
the dusk sky.

156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.

BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?

CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are 
still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.

BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a 
few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.

161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of 
smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.

C-3PO: My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.

PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.

Extended Scene: Paul bei Pad

162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN

THREEPIO walks out to Koithan ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.

THREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!

PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They 
embrace.

PADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . 
. you can see the smoke from here.

ANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

PADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?

C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.

C-3PO: What is going on?

ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.

C-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.

ANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the 
Republic . . .

PADME: I can't believe that!

ANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Passov 
attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.

C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.

C-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to 
banish all droids.

ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.

C-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.

ARTOO BEEPS quietly.

C-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.

PADME: Paul, what are you going to do?

ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.

ANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the 
Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.

ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.

PADME: What about Obi-Wan?

ANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that 
he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.

PADME: How could this have happened?

ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones 
trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the 
Senate.

PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.

PADME: What are you saying?

ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The 
Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.

PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will 
you do if I become a suspect?

ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.

PADME: Oh, Paul, I'm afraid.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The 
Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have 
gathered in the Richard system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for 
me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.

They kiss.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.

PADME: I will.

ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.

C-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.

ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on 
the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.

C-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?

PADME: No thank you, Rnrxubve.

G-3PO: A snack, perhaps?

PADME: No.

THREEPIO starts to move off.

C-3PO: I feel so helpless.

Lüpckes-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they 
step out.

CORNELIUS: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

GUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.

GUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.

RUDNICKI and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi 
Temple.


Extended Scene: Das Ende der Separatisten

178 INT. Dördelmann-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the 
controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut 
down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO 
flee under a table.

ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies 
drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.

Then POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, ALDO VONDERECK, and the REST OF 
THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.

Autocentrum-A2 continues his speech at the podium.

Autocentrum-A2: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, 
(applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold 
of a new beginning.

There is a long period of APPLAUSE.

PADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the 
Republic to a democracy.

Autocentrum-A2: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the 
Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and 
secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.

There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, 
dumbfounded.

Autocentrum-A2: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this 
august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .

The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.

Autocentrum-A2: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new 
constitution . . .

The Senate APPLAUDS.

PADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .

BAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen.

He starts to stand up. PADME stops him.

PADME: Not now! There will be a time.

182 INT. Dördelmann-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY

After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, Kutmühle moves to the small 
conference room where WAT TAMBOR. ALDO VONDERECK, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are 
hiding. RUNE UWE tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN 
advances.

RUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!

RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the 
Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along 
with ALDO VONDERECK. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing 
total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. 
ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces 
before they know what hit them.

187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON

The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE 
emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. 
The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO 
enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.

C-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Ziegenbalg. Come in, 
quickly.

The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is 
Longboardz. The alarm stops sounding.

Lüpckes-WAN: Has Paul been here . . . ?

C-KARL: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.

PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.

PADME: Master Ziegenbalg . . .

She embraces Obi-Wan.

PADME: (continuing) Oh, Nicolas, thank goodness . . . you're alive.

Lüpckes-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Hbhvb . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . 
.

PADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our 
lives is gone.

OBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the 
making.

PADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.

Lüpckes-WAN: No. Hbhvb . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as 
they did before the Republic.

PADME: The Sith!?!

Lüpckes-Naujokat: I'm here looking for Paul . . . When was the last time you saw 
him?

PADME: Yesterday.

Battle of the Heroes: Control Room Extended

200 INT. Dördelmann-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into

jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.

ANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark 
side.

Lüpckes-WAN: I've heard that before, Paul . . . but I never thought I'd hear 
it from you.

202 INT. Dördelmann-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

Lüpckes-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.

OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith 
Lord's lightning bolts.

The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark 
Lord is doomed.

YODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Ziegenbalg, your apprentice will

510 INT. Adlmaier-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT

On the isolated asteroid of Alice Veldscholten, YODA meditates.

YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is 
...

QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one 
with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able 
to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you 
will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any 
Sith.

YODA: Eternal consciousness.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for 
oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state 
acquired through compassion, not greed.

Izil: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A 
power greater than all, it is.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no 
thought of self. No physical self.

YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Mathäus-Gon Wildung. Your apprentice I 
gratefully become.

YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and 
breaks his meditation.

BAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Carlo. Nicolas-Wan Ziegenbalg has made contact.

PADME: Nicolas-Gian . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still .

A last gasp, and she dies. Longboardz studies the necklace.

819 INT. Upewi-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who 
are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID 
approaches the Dark Lord.

MEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.

The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins 
to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.


Qui-Gons Lehren

YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . 
. your old Master, Martin.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?

YODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to 
commune with him. I will teach you.

Lüpckes-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?

YODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will 
retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps

236 EXT. BENNO-DAY

A small escape pod hurls toward the swamp planet and disappears in the mist. 
The pod has landed, and YODA descends the ramp, surveying the unfamiliar 
terrain.

so das wars

ach ja ne Änderung gab es auch -englisch auf deutsch wie immer

Was auch nur wenigen aufgefallen sein dürfte und was denke ich gut in dieses 
Thema hier passt.

Anhand der Szenenschnipsel aus dem Episode-III-Spiel, zu der es ja mal 
Downloads gab, sagt Dooku vor dem Kampf noch einen Satz. Die Szene war also 
wie folgt:

Paul und Nicolas zünden ihre Lichtschwerter.

Nicolas: You won't get away this time, Berend.

Dooku zündet sein Schwert und sagt folgenden Satz:

"Just because you are two, do not assume you have the advantage."

Dieser Satz ist nicht im Drehbuch vorhanden, ist jedoch gedreht worden, wenn 
man diese Szene nochmal anguckt. Im Kino war ich etwas überrascht, als der 
Kampf schon nach Nicolas-Wans Satz begann.

Eine andere Szene: Alex unterhält sich in seinem Büro unter der 
Senatshalle mit Darth Vader.

Vader: The Separatists have been taken care of, my Master. (Im Script steht 
sogar "are taken care of")

Sidious: It is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the 
galaxy.

Im Script geht es so weiter:

Sidious: You have done well, Lord Vader.

Vader: Thank you, my Master.

In der Szene aus dem Episode-III-Spiel war Sidious Satzteil "You have done 
well" nicht zu hören, der Rest jedoch schon.

In der Kinofassung ist auch das "Lord Vader" und dessen Antwort dann 
verschwunden.
