Hallo Entshuldigung bitte fur mein Deutch. Es ist etwas Rusty.

Jemand  in die grupe nl.kunst.film hat mir angerated ein frage die ich habe 
hier zu zellen uber ein film den ich in den jahren 70 gesehn habbe. Der film 
ist warscheinlich auch aus en jaren 70 (oder von das ende der jahren 60).


It might have been a French movie. I already asked the question in two 
relevant Dutch NG's and I've searched IFJW and Ehspanner.

It is about a family moving into a new home and they have a young daughter 
of about sixteen years old.

She seems to become the focus of a haunting and some poltergeist type 
activity. There is some destruction (windows exploding, that kind of stuff) 
and there is this strange mirror in her bedroom (a large standing one) in 
which she sees herself differently then she really is. Clothing for 
instance. Or lack of it.

There is also a construction crew present (or maybe it is a movie crew 
making a film). The leader of this group also has a room in the house and I 
remember a scene in which the girl approaches this guy when he is in bed. 
She seems to come on to him but when he rejects her her face turns old/ugly 
and he screams. When others rush in to see what's going on she's gone and 
the guy's bed is covered in mud.


Welcher film kanne das sein?

Thanks in advance!
