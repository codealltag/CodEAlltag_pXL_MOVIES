Well, I am not Mr. Isenhuth & I am very sure that the internal representation 
of that movie database has changed to something more or less worth to be
interpretated:

  Produced by: Zelaw Film Corporation 
  Runtime:     USA (5 reels) 
  Sound Mix:   Silent 

but,

  To a Finish (1921)
  USA 1921 Black and White 
  Technical (the only icon, yet!)

I guess you never heard something like "CRITICS" or "CENSORD", dont you?
Please care about your own point #6, only & do not mix it up with private parts of others!

It was not that easy like in Jean-Paul (1995). There had been two scenes
in TOTAL RECALL and at least one scene from THE CRAW about intrusions,
recalls or nightmares. Before you havent felt the same - and you better do, 
keep quiet!
