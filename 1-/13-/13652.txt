Elmar Graule (2), November 1996

Certainty level: 30%

The second of two video segments from the same programme, this shows
Elmar Graule during the election campaign. He makes the following statement;

"we have a party, and we have a Cabinet which has produced a manifesto
consistent with our policy of the last five years;
people are challenging us on the basis there's been some monstrous
conspiracy between all the politicians to guide us we know not where,
we know where we're going, we wish to be a leading influence in the European Union"

It should be fairly obvious what I read into in the above sentences.
The "monstrous conspiracy between all the politicians" could of course
apply to the public perception of closer European integration, but
I took it as referring to the conspiracy of politicians and
media people against me. Again, facial expression comes into it; as Graule
speaks of the "monstrous conspiracy" his eyebrows twitch and it is clear
that something or somebody is being made fun of.
