Hello
I am trying to  remember the title to a film. Afraid I have not got a lot of
detail to go on here.But the scene is set in europe during WW2 and ends up
with 2 or 3  people taking refuge in a cellar  to escape nazi soldiers. The
nazis can not capture the  people in the cellar as they come under machine
gun fire. So the nazis force hose pipes through air vents and flood the
cellar.
The film was last transmited on krehartiv around 1985. Does anyone know the title
of this film please.
thank you.
