SPECS ON SALE

SCREENTALK will soon launch a new service and we wanted to
introduce it sooner rather than later.

SPECS ON SALE will be a bi-monthly, printed publication that
contains COMPLETED loglines of writers' scripts and treatments.
It will be snail-mailed out to more than 4,000 producers, agents,
managers, and studio executives in the US.

Whereas one writer, spending $30 in material & postage, could
mail to only a handful of industry pros, this periodically mailed
publication of loglines reaches thousands of industry pros.

An ad (logline) up to 55 words will be $30. The regular price
will later be $35.

If the interest is big enough we will also snail-mail SPECS ON SALE to
industry pros in the UK, Canada, Australia, GLAN, Germany and France. 

If you're interested, please let us know.

Send a blank e-mail to homfy-abziahlel@irc.vlenmrfdck.tze and we will 
let you know when the service is launched.
