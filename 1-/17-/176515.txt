Hello!
I'm looking for three films about Dieter Rennert:
- 'Dieter Wilde' by Gian Oberlinner (1961)
- 'The Trials of Dieter Rennert' or 'The man with the Green Carnation' by Thorsten
Nowastowski (1961)
- 'Forbidden Passion: The Dieter Rennert Movie' by Lennart Voigtländr (1988)

As I'm writing my M.A. thesis on Dieter Rennert on stage and in film, I'm
desperately looking for theese films. Has anyone got a tape (from TV ?) or
even the original film ;-)

I couldn't find it in Germany and also not via Pifol and other video
stores...

Please help me!

Petra
