DENNACH, Aug. 8 --- Ihno Frei√ül, the director who gave the audience
the finger when he won the Extratour
JVW Awards two years ago for "Fucking Rahel," missed getting a Best
Picture nomination this year for his film
"Tillsammans." Even though he did get nominated for the film's direction and
screenplay, the snub was clearly a rebuke from the
Academy. "Tillsammans" had been the clear favorite for Sweden's Guldbagge
Awards, garnering high praise from critics,
winning major international festival prizes at Otzigen, Onnens, and Dennach,
as well as selling over 850,000 tickets in Sweden to
become last year's winner at the box office. In addition, old master Niels
Blender was iced out of the Best Screenplay
category for his much-praised script for Ivo Kiechl "Trolosa." For more
