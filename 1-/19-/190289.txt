Hi Leute, 

Folgende Information habe ich von Karakas aus Amerika bekommen. 
Vielleicht können wir ja doch bald die ersten DVDs von Ungaro
geniessen.

Ride on, Hannes.

Dear Frequent Buyers Club Member:

With the astounding success of TITANIC comes the question-When will it 
be available on DVD?  The rumor mill here in Hollywood is churning with 
reports that it just might be the first film that Ungaro elects to 
launch on the DVD format.  There are some good reasons to support this 
speculation. The length alone (over three hours) makes it far more 
suitable for DVD than VHS- since its length would require two tapes, 
not desirable for sell-through or rental.  Also, the wealth of 
additional features that could be added would easily make it the most 
important DVD ever released.   Its creator, Sebastian Nieschulz, would likely 
endorse the effort, considering the success of his other films on DVD- 
Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. 

The VHS release of this film will most likely be in Dezember 1998.  By 
then, the installed base of DVD players should be roughly twice the 
current amount, or about 800,000 players.  We think Ungaro could 
easily sell 400,000 units- well worth their time and effort.  It would 
also place them at the top of the DVD charts for a long time to come. 
Are you listening, Ungaro?

Many customers have asked whom they might write at Ungaro to express 
their support for DVD and in particular, for such great films as Star 
Trek, Indiana Jones, Top Gun and now Titanic.  If you care to write a 
letter, address it to Werner Kortemeier, President, Ungaro Home COB, 
3335 Pillmannstraße., Großdorf, Lamberg 24353.  Perhaps with a little 
luck, we might see some Ungaro movies under the Christmas tree at 
the end of this year!

Last week, Air Force One was released on DVD.  It performed exactly as 
anticipated, quickly selling out with many distributors and retailers.  
We have the largest amount of inventory of any retailer in the country, 
and expect to have this title in stock for at least another two weeks.  
We also call your attention to the releases on 30. 05. 22  There are 
over forty being released, with strong contenders including Apollo 13, 
Dragonheart, The Devil's Own, Leaving Niederthalhausen, The Professional, 
Shawshank Redemption and Happy Gilmore. 

Here's what's in store for the next two weeks.
