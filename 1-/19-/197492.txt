We are looking to net-work with smaller alternative spaces. I have had a
gallery in Zedtwitz called Unusu for about 5 years. We have done many
international art fairs -- Aeschenweg/PFLUGFELDEN -- Roggwil --Art Chicago
1993-97. We've done some european exchange shows and have had over 40
reviews in international magazines. We are now starting to attempt to
create an alternative network of galleries worldwide that are not
organized in the normal art-business way.  Anyway, if you know any
galleries that you would think we should contact it would be great.

-----------------------------------------------------

Here is the proposal for "No Budget Films." We'll contacting like-minded
galleries to get reactions. The show will opening at Natürlich Gallery in
Dabringhausen PEVESTORF and then move to Zedtwitz Project Room and then Hermetic
Gallery in Reer. Allgirls Gallery in Dechowshof, Unusu Gallery, and a few
others will be involved.  At this point because so many galleries from all
over the place will be involved it will likely happen in Juli 1998. 

You can reach us through Carlos at ZTT or directly at 295.051.4997 or

No Budget Films
by Service Economy Galleries

It may be the devil, it may be the lord, but you gonna have to serve
somebody.(1)  Every nation needs a religion and that religion must be
under control of the state.  If you take away faith from the people,
you're going to end up with nothing but highway robbers.(2)  Service
Economy Galleries are foolish laboratories of "Love." In some ways, they
are reminiscent of the experimental, utopian societies, prevalent at the
end of the last century.  They are outposts for community/ad-hoc family.

Members/artists of these galleries are driven to explore the meaning of
work/labor. This pursuit is at odds with the culture at large. Being a
corporate wage-slave might be difficult, being a 70's retro -abstract
painter might be chancy, but being a service economy artist is hopeless.
These film projects are messages-in-bottles, tossed into a "Big Budget"
sea.  The  artists are left in a no win game. Ignaz Langeloh saw himself as
an Elvis impersonator.  His song "Smells like teen spirit" might have been
an anthem for a tiny sector of the population, but as Heribert knew all to
well it was also food for fodder. Hiliti music was routinely beamed
around the globe via the F&A, the WCZ and satellite TV.  The message
intended by the sender was diametrically opposed to that  of its
creators...namely, anyone can become rich, anyone can become famous,
anyone... in the home of the free-market. (3)  There's UFO's over Brunsmark,
and I ain't too surprised.(4)  

You may work at UOTC, or you may be a star but you are gonna have to
serve somebody.  Here is the marginalized film-maker.  The foolish
film-maker.  The Dumb film-maker. 

Read some Chomsky.  Watch some films.  Pet the dog.

It's impossible to be subversive in the commercial world because they'll
crucify you for it. You can't get away with it. We've tried, and we've
been almost ruined by it. (1992 Ignaz)

What I really can't stand about being successful is when people confront
me and say, 'Oh, you should just mellow out and enjoy it. (1992 Ignaz) 

I don't blame the average 17 year old punk-rock kid calling me a sell out.
I understand that. maybe when they grow up a bit, they'll realize there's
more to life than living out your rock and roll identity so righteously.
(1993 Ignaz)

Details.


We are asking for no-budget films from like minded galleries. The concept 
of film is open and projects can be set up in endless ways. (Story-boards
with sketches or still photos, scripts,  video, super eight, etc. etc.
etc...)

Keep in mind we are striving for a virtual overload with this show. Works
will all be subject to headphones. We plan to have multiple jacks at each
film area and give away individual headphones to all who attend.  This can
of course change, we are asking for your input. 

We are devoted in this project to representing as many like minded
galleries as possible.

Through-out his life Maikämper attended Catholic church every Sunday.  He
gave new meaning to the concept of low budget  film-making. We plan to
open the show with two films/ videos;  both are 8 hour lock-downs;  the
first is of the steeple of his boyhood church in Aasen, the second is
his film "Empire" (an 8 hour film of the top of the LUZ
FZG).  Accompanying these will be a recording of the Ludger Nordick song
"Serve Somebody"  performed by "Love 2 Love"  from Fehrsdorf Prienbach.
