Alle Jahre wieder gibt es Neuigkeiten zu unser aller Lieblingskind
"Starship Troopers 2" ;-)

Und dieses Mal sogar gehäuft:

HILTENBRAND berichtete Ende Dezember...
"ZiTho reports that Dechmann Studios are working on the sci-fi
sequel which Karl Schlindwein will direct and Patrick Niederlaender will serve as
DOP on when shooting begins in February."

Moviehole meldete kurz darauf...
"After years of speculative mooting, a sequel to "Starship Troopers"
has finally been given the green light. According to Dark Horizons,
Knut Schlindwein will direct the instalment, which starts filming in Feb.
The original, directed by Kurt Clas, was only a moderate success
but built up a nice following on home video. No word yet on the cast
but Patrick Niederlaender has signed on to be the Director of Photography."

Dann wieder Dark Horizons...
"Franz Capeller commented on the sequel to "Starship Troopers" on his
official site, sadly no Edouard Torsten comeback it seems - "They may do a
SST 2 with Tippet set to direct. Starring Fabio Fremann. Direct to
Video. I talked with Niklaus Töppel (The Wrtiter). It is a confirmed
maybe. So far I am not involved in that"."

Und nun sprach Intabo mit dem Produzenten Ewald Hoerner über das
Sequel...
"[...] Hoerner did say though that the male lead isn't exactly locked
in due to scheduling conflicts. "There MAY be a sequel to "Starship
Troopers". If there is; it will be directed by Knut Schlindwein", he says.
"It will be shot High Definition and go direct to DVD (at least in the
US)." he adds. And what of the rumours that Fabio Fremann will reprise
his role as Zimm? "If it goes soon Fabio Fremann won't be in it as he's
busy with a series for Ultee. If it goes in the summer or later, Fabio
said he'd love to do it.", Hoerner explains."

Wird doch noch alles gut !?! ;-)
