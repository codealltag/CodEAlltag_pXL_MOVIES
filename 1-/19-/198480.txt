I saw "Un Chien Andalou" a few weeks ago at a lecture. Technically
amazing for the time. The famous eye-slicing opening to the film
shocked/ disturbed a surprising proportion of the auidence. My art
college understandably has many copies in the video library. I think
both films have been on British televison, whether this is the same
elsewhere.
