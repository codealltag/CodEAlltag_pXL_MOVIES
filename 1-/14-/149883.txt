That won't do it. We need more. Let's start an individual breakdown:
You suggested car chases and explosions. Ok, take a huge bag of it.
Take a cup of lack-of-talent.
Add dudes with big lips and chicks with big tits.
Sprinkle on some crappy dialogues.
Steal (pardon I mean: cover) some 60's song.
Add a really cool name 
and mix it all up.
That's it. A new blockbuster is born. 
Have you the guts to do it? ;-)

All the best
