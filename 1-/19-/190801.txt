hi,

      I am a Singaporean studying in an Interior Architecture and Design
Course given a task to design for a Film Entertainment and Interactive
Design Company.
      I sincerely need help from personals working in a film company to
give me feedbacks about your working environments. If there's any
discontent about the design of your workplace, please don't hesitate to
tell me. I will be very grateful as I need your feedbacks in order to
design an effective workplace to suit your working lifestyles.
       Kindly reply soon. Thanks to whoever u are. It is greatly
appreciated for your spontaneity.

Walter.
