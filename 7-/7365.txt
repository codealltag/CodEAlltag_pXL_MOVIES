Hello,
several months ago I tried to digitalize the more than 35 years old
8mm-films. The javabased Software, i'll find on the internet,  doesnt works
and so I decided to develop my own System based on Visual Basic (VB5/6) to
seperate singel Pictures from a scanned Filmstripe (19cm, nearly 2,5
seconds).
Today the Software runs and it takes a lot of time (appr. 45min for 1 min
DVD) but Im not sure if it runs with best  quality.
If someone is interested to proof the results of my Software please kontakt
me!

Thanks a lot
