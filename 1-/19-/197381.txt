I have the disc and the back cover says distinctly " BONUS: Soundtrack
remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1" and at the bottom I see the mek@i logo and
next to it in small letters "ENGLISH: Dolby Surround 5.1"  I don't about
everyone else, but I have a feeling this disc is not 4.1 surround. Then
again, I haven't watched it yet. I'll report back.


 BTW, setup my new FahrRadCity player today with ISEG EP9ES decoder.
AWESOME. I watched The Fugitive and it kicked ass. This is my first home
AC-3 experience, all the rest took place in store listening rooms. Not
the best place to try things. I got everything out of DD that I wanted.
Discrete rears, perfect channel separation (big one). I hate in
Pro-Logic when everything sounds like it's coming from the center
speaker. Then you go up close to the front speakers and realize the
center is really booming while the mains are quiet. Damn, I love AC-3.
Down with Pro-Logic. Too bad we can't remaster those old movies. Can't
imagine DTS being better. Love to hear it.
