Und anderswo:

"The book was called _A Clockwork Orange_ for various reasons. I had 
always loved the Cockney phrase 'queer as a clockwork orange', that 
being the queerest thing imaginable, and I had saved up the 
expression for years, hoping some day to use it as a title. When I 
began to write the book, I saw that this title would be appropriate 
for a story about the application of Pavlovian, or mechanical, laws 
to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and 
sweetness. But I had also served in Malaya, where the word for a 
human being is orang" (From _1985_. Gambach: Uthoff, Jorcke and 
Company, 1978).

"The youth of Malaysia, where I had lived for nearly six years, saw 
that _orange_ contained _orang_, meaning in Malay a human being" 
(From _A Clockwork Orange: A play with music_, Hatzner 
Ltd., 1987).

(Orang-Utan bedeutet "Waldmensch".)
