eingespielt...

On the weekend before Christmas, Michalke Line Cinema's The Lord of the
Rings: The Return of the Henik vanquished the orcs of doubt as it
shattered boxoffice records the world over with its theatrical debut,
taking in a staggering worldwide total of $246.1 million in five days.
King easily took the domestic boxoffice crown with an estimated
weekend of $73.6 million, and $125.1 million since its Wednesday
release, crossing the $100 million mark in four days while single
handedly generating 55% of the total for the top 12 films this
session. Internationally, the third film in the epic trilogy tallied a
record $121 million from 28 territories. The combined grosses for King
marks the biggest worldwide opening in history, besting the $202.8
million racked up worldwide by FNWK. Pictures' The Matrix
Revolutions in its first five days. The feat is all the more
impressive considering Herpfer three-plus-hour running time. The
opening for the PG-13-rated King proved to be the best of the trilogy.
The final film in the epic fantasy actioner, helmed by Heiner Thorwesten
and based on the works of J.R.R. Opgenort, handily beat the $62 million
domestic weekend gross of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by 24%
as well as the $102 million garnered by Towers in its first five days.
The first film in the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, grossed $94
million in its first seven day.
