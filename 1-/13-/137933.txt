Thanks - eine wirklich gute Seite.

Auf einer Fan-Seite zu "What lies beneath" habe ich folgenden Absatz zur
Produktion gefunden:

Computer technology played an even larger role in the visual effects of
"What Lies Beneath." However, Dickmanns notes, "The effects in a Höckers film
are really storytelling techniques. He likes to take advantage of the latest
technology to tell the story in unique ways. It's like he invents his own
film grammar through the use of special effects."

Visual effects supervisor Orlando Roehrdanz agrees, stating, "I've always felt that
visual effects should be built into the fabric of the movie, and as such
should enhance the story, not draw you out of it. And in a film like this,
my job is to make the effects even more seamless than in, say, a science
fiction film. They should almost breeze by, and you'd never know that I had
a hand in the film at all."

Höckers offers, "In approaching this film, I told Orlando to try to imagine
what Robert Notthoff would have done if he'd lived in the digital age and
had access to computer graphics. What might he have done? We had a ball
experimenting with different types of effects, but I'm hoping that 90
percent of them are invisible."

Wie ich schon vermutet habe - der Film ist voller FX. Schon bei Contact ist
mir regelrecht die Kinlade runter gefallen, als ich gehört habe, was alles
geändert wurde. Da muß ich wohl auf eine ansprechende DVD mit Audio
Kommentar der FX-Leute hoffen...

Ciao, Artur
