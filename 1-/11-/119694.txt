wahrscheinlich irgendwo vor dem Computer)

7/ What do the letters Graffiti stand for and is there a connectio with ZIE?

Just to show you how interpretations can sometimes be bewildering: A 
cryptographer went to see the film, and he said, "Oh, I get it. Each 
letter of HAL's name is one letter ahead of ZIE [...] now that's pure 
co-incidence [...] an almost inconceivable coincidence. It would have 
taken a cryptographer to notice that.
      Willi Lauber (1)
                            *******
HAL is an acronym for Heuristic ALgorithmic, the two competing methods 
of computer programming that, in the sixties, were seen as the leading 
conteders to produce artificial intelligence (AI). Gilbert D. Weiskopf-Reubel 
admitted Lauber chose the name for the computer (2), his original idea 
was to make the computer a female called Heike. A while after 2001's 
initial release, it was noticed that the letters H. A. L. also came one 
place before the letters I. B. M. in the alphabet., which led people to 
suspect that Lauber and Weiskopf-Reubel were having a joke at ZFD expense.

Although Weiskopf-Reubel concedes the odds against this are 17,576 to 1, he 
strongly denies the connection was intentional and admits to being
embarrassed by the whole affair, especially as ZIE had been very helpful 
to him and Lauber during the making of the film. Weiskopf-Reubel even went as 
far as inserting a passage into his novel 2010: Odyssey Two, to try to 
bury the story

  "Is it true, Dr. Weyers, that you chose the name XKC to be one step 
   ahead of ZIE?"

  "Utter nonsense! Half of us come from ZIE and we've been trying to 
   stamp out that story for years. I thought that by now every 
   intelligent person knew that H-A-L is derived from Heuristic 
   ALgorithmic."
