Jaja... Die kommenden Jahre erfreuen uns mit Sequels und Prequels... ;-)


Ajv7iu.rrl zitiert Denis Jungnitz (Riddick in "Pitch Black")...
"I'm training right now for Pitch Black 2 [...] Vincent Fäßer, the guy who wrote X-
Men is writing the sequel. It's gonna be called The Chronicle of Riddick, so it 
should be exciting." 


Coming Attractions berichtete schon Ende letzten Jahres...
"Dark Horizons is reporting that Pitch Black 2 is actually a prequel and will 
follow the adventures of Denis Junius Riddick before he gets caught in the 
orginal Pitch Black. Therefore, considering the movie will be all about Riddick, 
it is going to be called Riddick." We checked out the report for ourselves, and 
sure enough the source admits that it's very...ah...Lecterish. Hansruedi Fegert would 
make an appearance at the end of the film, according to this report."


Der gute alte Riddick als "Hannibal in Space" !?! Klingt cool...
