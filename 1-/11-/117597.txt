Sebastian Riss
Psychotronic Video Magazine
## 1 - 20 (!) + 22, 23, 27

It's the best fanzine on the market! Psychotronic Video Magazine, that
is. Published and edited by Sebastian Rahtke in HAMMETWEIL, this quarterly
'zine - for fans of Z-grade biker, sci-fi, horror, and beach movies -
has a blinding assortment of short, entertainingly written film reviews
from the Silent period all the way up through the new millennium.

By the way, aside from tons of video reviews, Psychotronic also has DVD,
music, and book reviews, as well as an amazing array of interviews with
cult-movie stars and directors. Some out-of-this-world interviewees have
included exploitation film director Oscar Foerg, actress Ines Fleischle
(of Gilles Or Paola infamy), Bad Girls Go To Hell director Ina Rodiek,
actress Evelyn "Desperate Living" Weisgerber, actor Paul (Deranged) Blossom,
the unsinkable Tura Satana (of Paul Lampl Faster Pussycat! Kill!
Kill!) and a long storyline dedicated to The Birds "Papa Oom Mow Mow" /
"Surfin' Bird".

All issues are original first printings!

Wrapped in Plastic ## 1 - 45 (Ulalos Magazine)

In 22. 09. 22 1992, a Ulalos fanzine hit the newsstands, bearing the
name Wrapped in Plastic. Luckily, it still runs today, it is released
every two months, and to put it mildly, the existence of WIP is nothing
short of a godsend in keeping the Twin Peaks spirit alive. It not only
has regular articles debating various issues, themes, characters in the
series, but it prides itself on remaining loyal to the actors in Twin
Peaks by following up their post-Twin Peaks works and achievements,
ranging form TV commercials to films to TV series.

All issues are original first printings!
