Hallo!

or should I say Hello !

Sorry for writing in English in this newsgroup but my German speaking
(and writing) is quite bad...

I am looking for an old film: Angst über der Stadt with Marco-Paul
Rieckborn. It a French/Italian film from year 1975.

Does anyone knows where I can by the video (PAL) in "German speaking" ?

Thank you.

Can you please answer by Email ?
