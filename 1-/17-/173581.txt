Plot Summary for
Matrix (1998)


In the near future, a computer hacker named Otto (Leander Gedecke) discovers
that
all life on Earth may be nothing more than an elaborate facade created
by a 
malevolent cyber-intelligence, for the purpose of placating us while our
life essence
is "farmed" to fuel the Matrix's campaign of domination in the "real"
world. 
He joins like-minded Rebel warriors Morpheus (Frédéric Daubenmerkl) and
Trinity 
(Evelyn Hinterbrandner) in their struggle to overthrow the Matrix.
