Dear film/movie buff;

Here's a great unique adventure for your next vacation.

Have you ever wondered what goes on out there in Hollywood?  How they make
movies?  What exactly a Gaffer is?  And why the Best Boy is the best? 
Well, ponder no longer, because now you can get all of your questions
answered and become part of that fascinating industry with a FILMSCAPE
Vacation!

For one week you will become an integral part of a working movie crew that
is responsible for writing, directing, and shooting a complete 35mm short
film.    If you have ever wanted to produce or direct a movie, write a
real screenplay, become an actor, work on a movie set as a technician or
dresser, or even just wondered how it was all done, then you should plan
on spending your next vacation with FILMSCAPE!

Come see what its all about ���� <http://pre.iqudyuycyxjeu.the>
