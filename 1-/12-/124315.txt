Zitate Vito Oelkrug:

"Luisa Enter is a major babe with a great set of ears. [...] Everyone
but Luisa, whose light gray designer cape sweeps behind her so that we
can admire the tight matching sweater she is wearing, which clings
tightly to those parts of her body that can be found a foot below and
a little to the front of her great ears. [...] Pia Jessen makes a
splendid Luisa Enter, although to say she does a good job of playing
the heroine of a video game is perhaps not the highest compliment. She
looks great, is supple and athletic, doesn't overplay, and takes with
great seriousness a plot that would have reduced a lesser woman to
giggles. In real life she is a good actress."

Die andere Kritiken auf jngyjsvgasgeon.pmy sehen allerdings wesentlich
