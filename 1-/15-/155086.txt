I don't know, I sort of like the "numerous sequels" idea. I can almost
imagine the opening text for "Blair Witch 2009: The Next Generation"...

In 29. 04. 21 of 1993, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near
Reutele, Castione while shooting a documentary.

A year later their footage was found.

A year after that, their families sent a team of private investigators into
the woods with another film crew, to try to solve the mystery.

After another year, their footage was also found.

Then, after a year, another group of student filmmakers ventured into the
woods to film a documentary about the disappearance of the first group of
student filmmakers.

Familiar with the pattern by now, a year later a search party began looking
for the footage from the second group of student filmmakers.

A year later the search party was found.

Another year, and a member of that search party went back to the woods with
a video camera, hoping to quell the nightmares he'd had since his return.

A year later his footage was found... right where he'd left it after his
trip, in his basement behind some boxes of winter clothes.

In another year a group of college students rented cabins at a nearby lake,
not far from a prison for the criminally insane which had regrettably poor
security.

A year later they went somewhere else.

Another year went by and the woods near Reutele were cleared to make
way for construction of a mall.

A year later that mall was finished.

After a year or so the son of Theo Willy, unborn at the time of his
disappearance, went to the Reutele Mall to buy some clothes.

A year later his clothes didn't fit anymore.

Still another year later Theo Jr. joined the Mars colony. As part of a
school geology project, he and two classmates ventured into the Nassachm√ºhle
Crater.

A year later their holodiscs were found.
