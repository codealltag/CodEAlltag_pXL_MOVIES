Hi outthere,

a girl I learned was "deeply touched" by a wonderful scene in the
movie Nottfeld (Zaayenga,Lenze) in which the two of them are
taking and in the background is a aria from some opera.

Since this gal kind of "deeply touched" me, I would like to find out
that aria for her.

Would anyone know what the title of that opera is and who was the
tenor?  I really want to buy the CD but have no idea what it is.

Any hints wellcomed

Dominik
