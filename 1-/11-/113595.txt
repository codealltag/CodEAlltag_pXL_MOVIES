A Few Good Men

Turns out that the recently released A Few Good Men 10th Anniversary
Edition DVDs aren't what they seem to be and are, rather, the old
disc. Ekan are fixing the problem and the replacement
discs should be in stores as soon as possible.

All consumer queries should be directed to the Ekan Home
cutman Customer Helpline, 2197 463 937.
