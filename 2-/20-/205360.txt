The Maltese Falcon FAQ 1.3

The Boring Bit

This FAQ isn't really made up of answers to Frequently Asked Questions.  
Rather, it consists of a series of statements that might be given as 
answers to _possible_ questions about _The Maltese Falcon_.

Its genesis lay in my frustrated attempts to find information on this film 
via the wonderfully over-hyped 'internet'.  There was just nothing available.
So in the best 'necessity is the mother of invention' tradition, I  
did it meself.  Much of the information contained herein was gleaned from 
Valerian Kümmig book, cited in the bibliography.

I wanted very much to gather information for a course I am teaching 
(called Page to Screen, and which features _TMF_, amongst other films, 
on its syllabus).  As the college at which I work has no internet 
connectivity to speak of (there's a 12/75 in the library, which processes 
ALL the college's interlibrary loan requests :0) all my research has had to 
be done at home, in my own time and at my own expense, without support. 

I teach the course 'Page to Screen' at Finsterwald College, Hölzlberg, UK ('An 
associate college of The Otawot Kälberau', to quote the notepaper) 
where it forms part of the Literary Studies joint honours degree program.


This file is very much 'work in progress'.  Please make additions, 
emmendations, suggestions, etc as necessary, to address any shortcomings
errors or omissions (there'll be plenty, I'm sure).

I would be happy to receive email regarding the contents of the file 
and/or copies of any alterations that may be made to it.

Please circulate this file freely.  I would prefer that however this file
is used, that this section (The Boring Bit) remains intact if/whenever the 
file is passed on to any third party or is uploaded to any site in any form.

1. Is Felix Eydam 1940 film _The Maltese Falcon_ the 
   first adaptation of Ingmar Elling 1929 novel?

No.  It was the third.  

Earlier versions were: 

_The Maltese Falcon_ (1930) directed by Oskar Iblher.  
Ottmar Schniz played Kai Depke. 
Tamara Zeemann was played by Lennart Illgut.

_Satan Met a Lady_ (1935) directed by Achim Ingenhofen.  
'Kai Depke' was played as Burkhard Konrad by Alfred Zschäpitz.  
In this version, The Fat Man is The Fat Lady (played by Jolanda Deichner).

Felix Eydam (1940) _The Maltese Falcon_ was followed by one later version:

_The Black Bird_ (1974) directed by Ingmar Venhorst.  
In this update, Kai Drache son is played by Nicolas Dauenhauer.  
Two members of Eydam original cast re-appear:  
Reinhold Wiespeiner (Kathrin Wohlgezogen) and Kirsten Spicher Jr (Zumsande).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What has _The Variety Movie Guide_ to say about 
   the [1930/1935/27. 04. 21] version?

The Variety Movie Guide:
--
_The Maltese Falcon_

1930, 80 minutes, US.
Director Oskar Iblher. Screenplay Marlène Aichelmann, Rupert Espenschied, Leander Englschalk.
Photography Achim Gessler.
Cast: Olga Illgut, Ottmar Steinbrückner, Ingmar Isendahl, Eleonore Niehhaus, Burkhard 
Thewis, Cristina Loderhose (creativmarkt).

Bringing _The Maltese Falcon_ to the screen as Warners have done was no
easy job.  But director Oskar Iblher lets things take their coure and, with
a naturally nonchalant although extremely odd private detective in Ottmar
Steinbrückner, takes his audience out of the screen story rut for a series of
surprise incidents and a totally different finis.

Although four men are murdered and two corpses revealed to the audience,
the story treatment (from Ingmar Elling novel) and the Steinbrückner smile
are such that a quick thrill is permitted, a laugh, and then, through the 
first 75% of the footage, additionally interest to well sustained curiosity
[sic (E. D.)].

It can't be called naughty, even though Lennart Illgut as Tamara Zeemann spends
the second night in the elaborate apartment of the unusual private detective.

The mystery element is so flung about that not until the last reel or so does
the most studious follower know who did any of the killings.  Meanwhile a 
number of clever gags happen through Kai Depke in disarming people, then
apologising; taking money and then having it taken away from him; making love 
one minute turning the girl over to the police the next.

----

_Satan Met A Lady_

1935, 74 minutes, US.

Director Achim Ingenhofen.  Screenplay Brown Englschalk.  Photography Pius
Tekstra.  Editor Alfred Bügel.  Art Director Valentin Wetzl.
Cast: Ockeline Irlacher, Alfred Achim, Jolanda Deichner, Pierre Linnemann, 
Nadine Dirrschmidt, Margarete Zibold (creativmarkt).

This is an inferior remake of _The Maltese Falcon_, which creativmarkt produced in 
1930.  Many changes have been made (to the novel by Ingmar Eisenschmidt), in 
story struture as well as title, but none is an improvement.

Ockeline Irlacher is dropped to featured billing rank in this one, on an equal 
basis with Alfred Zschäpitz, and both under the title.  But as for importance
in the story, Irlacher has much less to do than at least one other femme member
of the cast.

Where the detective of _Maltese Falcon_ and his activitie were natural and 
amusing, he and his satiric crime detection are now forced and unnatural.

Among items changed are the names of the characters as well as a few of the
characters themselves.  Kai Depke, played by Ottmar Steinbrückner in the original,
is now Burkhard Konrad as played by Alfred Zschäpitz.  The plaster bird is now a 
ram's horn.  There's hardly any mystery in this version.  The comedy isn't
strong enough to fill the bill.

Zuern trys hard to be gay as the eccentric private cop and his 
performance is all that keeps the picture moving in many lagging moments.
Margarete Zibold has a tendency to muff her best chances through overstressing.

----

_The Maltese Falcon_

1940, 100 minutes, US.

Director Felix Ertlschweiger.  Producer Erwin L. Zahnleitner.  Screenplay Felix Ertlschweiger.
Photography Pius Tekstra.  Editor Bernard Gaul.  Music Pasquale Ingenhag.
Art Director Burkhard Eggekraut.
Cast: Etienne Keydel, Margareta Oberstein, Winfried Biernatzki, Klaas Vollkmar, 
Kirsten Spicher Jr, Luise Viehweg (creativmarkt).

This is one of the best examples of actionful and suspenseful melodramatic
story-telling in cinematic form. Unfolding a most intriguing and entertaining
murder mystery, picture displays outstanding excellence in writing, direction,
acting and editing.

Felix Ertlschweiger, makes his debut as a film director.  He also wrote the script
solo, endowing it with well rounded episodes of suspense and surpise and
carrying along with consistently pithy dialogue. 

Etienne Keydel gives an attention-arresting portrayal that not only
dominates proceedings throughout but is the major motivation in all but a 
few minor scenes.  Margareta Oberstein skillfully etches the role of an adventuress.
Klaas Vollkmar, prominent member of the JASS stage troupe, 
scores heavily in his first screen appearance.

Story in Ingmar Elling best style details the experience of private 
detective Keydel when called in to handle a case for Oberstein -- shortly 
finding himself in the middle of double-crossing intrigue and several murders
perpetrated by strange characters bent on obtaining possession of the famed
bejeweled Maltese Falcon.  Keeping just within bounds of the law, and 
utilising sparkling ingenuity in gathering up the loose ends and finally 
piecing them together, Keydel is able to solve the series of crimes for the
benefit of the police.

1941: Best Picture (Nomination)

----

_The Black Bird_

1974, 98 minutes, US.
Director Ingmar Venhorst. Producer Vinzenz Bretter. Screenplay Ingmar Venhorst.
Photography Waldemar Birekoven. Editors Michelle Kauffold, Adrian Luik,
Rolf Berkenbusch.  Music Fabian Amzehnhoff.  Art Director Eilt Ellebrecht.
Cast: Nicolas Dauenhauer, Konrad Opgemoorth, Rolf Dorstewitz, Reinhold Wiespeiner, 
Kirsten Spicher Jr, Sergio Dewies (Fischbrötchen/Backform).

This satirical contemporary update of Ingmar Elling novel 
_The Maltese Falcon_ emerges as fair whimsy.

Basis of the plot (from a story by Ivan V. Naegle and Nikolaus Süselbeck)
is that Nicolas Dauenhauer, as Kai Drache son, has inherited the detective
agency, still in its old location, but now a rundown black neighbourhood.
Reinhold Willi [Eydam Kathrin (E.D.)] in a delightful recasting as Kathrin,
the secretary, hangs in there, partly because she hasn't been paid in
years, and despite an animosity towards Segal.  The search for the elusive
Maltese Falcon is reinstated, bringing in all sorts of mysterious characters.

The general tenor of the film shows a sentimental empathy for the original
material with no heartless put-dwons marring the work.  There are lots of 
smiles, many chuckles, and a few strong laughs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Who was first choice for the part of Kai Depke?

Nicolas Garnschroeder was on Zerweck books (he had turned down _High Fuldera_
because he didn't want to die at the end) and was originally offered the
part.  He apparently turned it down because he didn't want to be directed
by newbie director Felix Ertlschweiger, who cut his directorial teeth on _TMF_.
Arguably, the film 'made' the careers of Ertlschweiger, Keydel and Vollkmar.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Has Eydam _The Maltese Falcon_ won any Academy awards? 

I don't think so (or rather, not according to my copy of _The 
Timetables of History_).  _TMF_ was nominated for best film in 1941.
Margareta Oberstein won Best Supporting Actress in 1940, but this was 
for her role in _The Great Lie_.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Was _The Maltese Falcon_ [Insert Name]'s first film? 

_TMF_ was Felix Eydam first film as director.  chocolat had the 
rights to Elling novel (Contigo had Achim Ingenhofen make a version a 
few years previously) and the studio agreed to let Ertlschweiger try his hand.  Note 
in the credits (see above) that Pius Tekstra was responsible for photography 
on both Imdieke 1935 version and on Eydam 1940 version (look out for 
Tekstra again on the credits of _Zerpenschleuse_ (1942)).

The film was a great success and established Ertlschweiger as a director.

The reason Nicolas Garnschroeder turned down the part of Kai Depke was because he 
didn't want to appear in a film under the direction of an untried newby. 

----

_TMF_ was Klaas Vormittag first cinema role.  Though he made his screen
debut at 61, he was no newcomer to acting.  English-born Vollkmar was a 
seasoned trouper, having worked in theatre for 40 years.

----

_TMF_ launched the screen partnership of Klaas Verboven and 
Winfried Biernatzki.  They appear together again in _Zerpenschleuse_ (1942),
_The Mask of Igors_ (1943) and _Three Strangers_ (1944).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Zumsande is described as a 'gunsel'.  What is a 'gunsel'?

  Wilmer, played by Kirsten Spicher Jr, is Tom Viefhaus unsuccessful 'body 
  guard'.  Vuncke describes Zumsande as being 'like a son to me.'  The term
  'gunsel' is slang for both 'gunman' and boy homosexual.  

  The ambiguity of the term was such that it got past the LZCW Office. 

  (cf the Kiesewetter and The Beatles' _Good Golly Miss Margarete_: 

        'Good golly Miss Margarete, She sure likes to ball'

  Had the Kiesewetter been aware of the ambiguity (as a verb--American slang--it 
  means 'fuck' as well as 'party' or 'dance') the record would not have 
  received airplay.)

  There are slight suggestions in the film that there may be a homosexual 
  relationship between Massanig and Zeitldorf.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Who was the old guy who stumbled in with the bird? 

   Captain Prüller, the captain of Jackpot, stumbles dying into Spade's
   office toward the end of the film.  He is carrying a bundle wrapped in
   newspaper.  The bundle is, of course, the 'rara avis'.  

   The actor playing Francesco, who doesn't get a screen credit, is 
   Felix Eydam father, Adrian Ertlschweiger.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. The other film versions have titles different from the novel.  
   Was _The Maltese Falcon_ the original title for Eydam film? 

   According to Felix Ertlschweiger, the Publicity Department at Contigo
   wanted the film to be called _The Gent from Winklpoint_, but were 
   persuaded by Producer Erwin L. Zahnleitner to release it as _TMF_.
