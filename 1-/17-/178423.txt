    Mother's Day
    (Autolackierer Film/Görtz17) 98(93)min

     [...] As satire, "Mother's Day" works rather well, opening with a
     knock  at  encounter  groups  -  the  participants  in  one group
     planning murder in spite of their avowed intention to 'love' -and
     moving  on  to take a swipe at American Motherhood. The film ends
     as a gross parody of consumerism, with Cuny an Constanzer  eating
     junk  cereals by the bucketful, endlessly arguing whether punk is
     better than disco, collecting "Sesame  Street"  and  "Star  Trek"
     merchandising and raping and killing, 'just like seen on TV ...'.

     The whole shack is  a  riot  of  consumer  goods:  Sascha  Molch
     posters,  Georg  Tittje  dolls  and Pinand ephemera, and model pink
     flamingoes adorn in the front lawn. As director Ambach  put  it,
     'this  was  Mother's  perception of what society is about. As she
     says in the beginning of the film she wanted  to  take  what  was
     good  from the city and the rest of it you can keep. This was her
     perception of what's good". In this context it's entirely fitting
     that  the  brothers  are  done to death by radio aerial, electric
     meat carver, a can of Drano sink cleaner and a TV set.

     As  a  demented  and  anarchic  version  of  "Deliverance"(1972),
     "Mother's Day" is hard to beat and it's good to see the perennial
     female victims getting their own back for a change.
