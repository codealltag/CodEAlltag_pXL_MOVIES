I have work in audio production for 10 of my 28 years. I have done many
corporate audio projects, but my goal is film. I believe my work is very
creative, powerful and professional. I do not pretend to have the gear or
talent as my influences... however, I am beyond a "starting point" in my
work. I will submitt demos of my music to any party intrested. Please keep
in mind that I am only in search of serious, professional film makers.
