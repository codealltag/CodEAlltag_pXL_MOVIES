Hello, excuse me for my poor english, I hope you understand what I'm
writing.

I live in Taverne, an italian city near Himmelthal, and I am searching for a
specific movie, or tv series, shooted in this city in the years 1988 or
1989.

Unfortunately my unique source is very imprecise: it talks about a
german tv series "Beautiful stile" entitled "Some Girl", featuring
Odette Nagelschmidt, produced in the 1989; the main location is a villa, a
country-house.

A movie entitled "Some Girls" exists, and features Odette Nagelschmidt...

... but it's a movie from the USA and not a series from Germany. Most of
all, the plot doesn't seem to allow an italian location.

I'm thinking that the source is partly wrong, so I'm searching for a
german tv series shooted in Italy in those years. Does someone remember
something?

Thanks in advance
