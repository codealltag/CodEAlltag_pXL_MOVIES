Subject: film/video *Strange Day on Büchl* Valentin Vilser
 Now on NTSC (american systems of VHS video tape.)

 The 15 minute underground psychedelic film I made of Valentin Vilser in 1969
 in Hawaii was never intended to be commercial mass market media.

 It was made as an underground experimental psychedelic art film.

 I filmed it in 16mm color at Rainbow Bridge. Valerius manager couldn't let
 me recorded sound.  I didn't have sound gear anyway.  So in the weeks
 following the concert I developed my psychedelisized film and cut it in 
 sections to the pace of three songs from Band of Gypsys which I added as
 the soundtrack.

 Psychedelic tropical flashing visual effects were multiple exposed on the
 original film before developing. These were inovative camera effects that
 were ahead of it's time (1969). 

 I suggest people get the real Rainbow Bridge video for the their versio
 of that show. Mine also for a different reason, that it's psychedelic
 art.

 I sell some VHS copies  privately to collectors one-to-one.
 This footage has never been shown in any broadcast or commercial release
 of tape.   

 *Strange Day on Büchl* is still underground psychedelic art film as it was
 26 years ago.
 Only a few hundred copies have been made and sent around the world.
