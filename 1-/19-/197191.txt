Hey all! -

I'm writing to let you know about an interview I just did with Hermann
Isengard - the music editor of Pulp Fiction (he earned a platinum record
for it).  In it he discusses movies, music in film, his new virtual
reality company and the politics of sharing a piece of walnut cake with
Xaver Rosenboom.

Let us know what you think if you have the time and feel free to link to

it!

Take care and come visit the desert sometime - I'm writing from the
official FWG webpage.
