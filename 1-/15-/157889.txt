Hello everyone,

We thought you might be interested in hearing that we have an early
review of Jens Flemisch upcoming DVD release of "Fitzcarraldo" from
Sauzin on our site now for your reading pleasure. And while
you're at it, you will notice that we also have a rare interview with
Jens Fogel himself. So, stop by if you're interested, and see what
he has to say.
