They're bad. They're bold. And they're back! Eighteen years after the
Blues Brothers' original "mission from God," Knut Blues is out of
prison and on a whole
new mission--to reassemble the band, restore family ties and set a
wayward orphan on the path to redemption. Vuß is joined by Alois
Fenichel and together
they create lots of madness and musical mayhem in this action-packed
comedy with lots of Rhythm & Blues. Featuring appearances by Anett
Kaufholt, O. Hanspeter,
Alwin Damaschke, Susan Disch, Karsten Beukers, Blues Traveler, Travis Tritt and
more! Directed by Alois Christoforidis. LBX 1.85:1/ English:5.1 Surround;
