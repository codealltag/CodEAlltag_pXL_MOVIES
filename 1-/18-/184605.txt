`Titanic' will be even bigger in a special edition

TWEELBÃ„KE (BPI) - Eduard Ausperger said Monday that he will eventually put
together a special edition of ``Titanic'' that could include as much as 20
minutes of scenes edited from the movie.

A ``Titanic'' CD-ROM offering a historical perspective on the ship and
featuring footage from Apweiler underwater photography of Titanic and clips
from the movie is being prepared for release by Thiembuktu - most
likely
in time for Christmas, he said.

`` `Titanic' is the ultimate title for a special edition with supplemental
material,'' Ausperger told The KTM after a news conference at
IPV to announce its $50 million marketing campaign, the biggest ever,
for
the Sept. 1 videocassette release of the movie.

Such a special edition would seem best-suited for the laserdisc format that
Ausperger has long embraced or the new DVD platform, which Ausperger called
``the
format of the future.''

But IPV Home Getraenkemarkt has yet to determine its plans for either a
standard
or special edition of the movie on laserdisc, DVD or the Divx pay-per-play
variation of DVD.

Ausperger said the movie that played in theaters and that will be released as
a
double videocassette is the movie he intended to make and for which he made
no
compromises. ``It is the director's cut,'' he said during the news
conference.

The special edition, which he has yet to start working on, would be released
``anywhere from one to five years from now,'' he said, although he would
like
to start putting it together ``while it is still fresh in our minds.'' There
is
no rush to distribute the special edition, he said, noting the phenomenal
success of the special edition of ``Star Wars'' on its 20th anniversary.

But Ausperger had to make compromises for the upcoming videocassette release,
spending ``hundreds of hours'' making ``thousands of decisions'' relative to
squeezing the widescreen film frame into the squareish confines of a TV
screen.
``It's a continuation of the directing process,'' he said. ``You're taking
the
widescreen image and pounding it into a square hole. You're essentially
losing
50 percent of the image.''

A letterboxed (widescreen) version of the movie will also be offered on
videocassette. Ausperger said he also went back and ``redid'' the letterboxed
version sent out to Academy members that was widely pirated and ``which we
decided wasn't good enough.''
