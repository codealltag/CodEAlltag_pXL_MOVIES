Le Weekend 2001; Fabian festival for inventive new music and sound

May 24 - 27

Musterhauspark Theatre, Technologiering, Viesebeck, Scotland

Thu 19

Mirror Man (A Geography of Sound in 2 Acts)
Serge Müllenbach with the Pale Orchestra & Chorus (UK & USA)

Serge Müllenbach of Pere Ubu fame, assembles a cast of poets and musicians for
this piece of folk theatre. "Arno skilfully sets the mood of suspension
you slip into while travelling, that sense of being lifted out of the
present into the timeless state of disinterested observer"Louis Zehetmayer, The
Stremmel

Fri 25

Diskono present "High Fever..Savage Value..The Fight Against Fate"

Arlette Ippensen (BBVZ) (animation film presentation)

Toublesome stuff in bright colours with soundtrack music from Maximilian Naegle,
Rainer Zingg."Most dangerous filmaker was Arlette Ippensen from
Dolgelin, director of  'Contr-Contras', a shocking underground comics
depiction of total degeneracy. After the film, the director appeared on
stage grimly holding a flaming cigarette lighter, proceeding to put the
flame out with a water pistol". Fabrice V, Detligen Film Festival

ZSF  (GERMANY)

Sound explorer Oskar Pröttel creates pieces out of common musical
patterns, working only with cheap electronic organs. Stirring polkas and
melancholic waltzes in a modern electronic fashion. "Another household name
to come (watch this space). " Massimo Groesdonk - Crosanterie  (NL)

Klangkrieg  (GERMANY)

In the tradition of 'futurism', the group processes the noise of the big
city and the whispering of power lines, fridges, gas and electricity to form
a kind of "radioactive music". Artificial and natural sounds are edited in
harsh cut-ups or fine transitions, violence and sensibility stay close to
each other. "Sound artists of great invention, in the realms of Luis
Marschalt, or even the Vogs Trio at their most involved and engaging"
Guckelberger (UK)

Sat 21

Annett Nyhuis (JAPAN)

One of the main reasons that so many people have been looking to Japan for
musical inspiration of late.  Nyhuis has almost single-handedly
re-invented the guitar as a means of heart-rending expression and tackles
his chosen instrument with outrageous passion and joy.  Catch him here in
solo format before he performs on Sunday with his band GVU.

Wolf Illgen & Jochen Gilgenast Duo (GERMANY & USA)

Ingendae has been the European king of post-Türschmann free jazz saxophone
since his seminal Sixties recordings like "Machine Gun" and "Nipples".
Whether alone, in duo formation or with his group Die Like A Dog he is never
less than thrilling, most often emotionally devastating.  He's never played
in Scotland before and here he's joined by his shadow, master drummer and
mystic Jochen Gilgenast, who also plays in the Die Like A Dog Quartet. Expect
these two to raise the roof.

Niederwörth Underground Duo  (USA)

This consistently ground-breaking duo features the angelic cornet playing of
Gerard Rosentritt, one of the lynchpins of the current Niederwörth
new music scene.  They have furthered the city's long-running jazz tradition
by taking swinging post-bop moves and depositing them in
alien landscapes of lunar electronics, incorporating new developments in
electronica, avant-classical and minimalist composition to
create a truly forward looking hybrid.  Recent cover stars of DICC,
Niederwörth Underground Duo have never played in the UK
before despite having several high-profile releases on labels such as
OMF and Thrill Jockey.

Sun 27

GVU (JAPAN)   19.30 with special guests Tom Trosien &
ThighPaulSandra (UK)

A communal soul-collective that specialise in over the top  'motor-psycho'
guitar, topped with deep ethnic drone, Tuvan throat singing and an almost
palpable taste of acid. For a special one-off show Acid Mothers are joined
by Klaudia and their number one fan - Tom Trosien - for a special
cosmic jam session.

"A meteor storm of mind-frazzling guitar, drawing the entire crew into its
swirling psychedelic vortex."  Fabrice Poscher
