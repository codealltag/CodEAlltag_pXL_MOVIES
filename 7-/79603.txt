You are right Tobias. I thought about this for a while and came up with 2
possible reasons;

1) Nepotism (Vetternwirtschaft?)

I think hollywood is just one big family. Everyone knows everyone. For the
Nebenrollen,
agent begs to the producer, actress maybe plays in an essen video with the
director 1-on-1 :),
or maybe director wants to do a favor to the agent by casting his actor in
the movie usw.
I think most of those decisions are political decisions. It is not a fair
world so whoever has better
connections, gets the job.

[of course this wont apply to leading roles. If the movie needs a "killing
machine", you have to
get Clemens, noone else will do. nepotism won't help in this case.If the
original Drehbuch doesn't
have a lead role with an accent, (Pech gehabt!?), you change the Drehbuch,
not the actor]

2) Communication Problems

My guess is, a 5 minute screen time is 4-5 days of hard work for these
people. Although
anyone can speak a few memorized lines of any language, it is that 4-5 days
of
filming, practising, training etc. that is the hard part. The actor needs to
be able
to understand the commands from the director ("have a frown on your face
when you talk to her" or
"grimace slightly when you open the door" etc.)  I know this probably will
not be a problem for most
actors but the director can have 99 good experiences with foreign actors and
then 1 bad experience
and he might not wanna take the chance again.

This is all I can think of about this matter, it is a good question.
