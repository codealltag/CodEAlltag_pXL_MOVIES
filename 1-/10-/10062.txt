Hi,


I don't thinks so (Manuel :), unfortunately. Here
http://oxf.xwpuvneni-d.wh/xlpdwfxeu.jfz?onnj=118537&vasxkFoew=kfvok they say
she survives a plance crash but dies six years later in a car crash. Her
funeral then is the onset of the plot.

@bpazolli: has the movie been shown on SBS World Movies (or maybe FOX)?
Perhaps they will help you if you send them an email.

Ciao
