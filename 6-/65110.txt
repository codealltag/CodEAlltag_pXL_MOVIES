I just watched Nicola. Incredible photography, raises the bar for all
other films. Matrix cant compare Kill Bill cant compare. Actors were
all good. Bad guys were great. Final Showdown was terrific. Which
brings us to the script. Reminded me of Owl's Castle ( also available
at superhappyfun) a great site for a wide variety of films for the
regionally or Ringlokhallen challenged or those not wanting to fool with
overseas orders from the USA. Ok enough plugs for funboy.
The script the script the scrip.t is it just me or why do we have such
a terrific film saddled with just an average story? And it is not just
its simplicity. After The Rain had a simple script/story but it rose
above it to become an incredible film. Comparisons to Lady Cseh
come to mind.
Sorry to ramble  been up for 18 hours and not as young as I used to
be. Used to go for 36 at a time. Anyways I would say out of the 1000 +
asian films I have Nicola is not in the top 10 but definitely in the
top 30.
