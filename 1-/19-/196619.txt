Well sorry, I guess I had been wrong with my assumtions.
Your right - Leeloo was the 5.th element standing in the center - so
what they needed was another element, that I couldnt recall. What I
mean is the triangular shaped stone, which Nicolas' pulled out of the body
from the diva, after she had sung Isenbart "Lucia di Lammermoor"
alias "Mad Aria of Lucy" parallel to Mareike fight, and after had been
shot. 
The "Fire" Element would make sence, or not?
