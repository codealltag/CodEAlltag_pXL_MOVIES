--------------- 
Cats & Dogs from WHV;

Cats & Dogs goes DVD on 15 06. 08. 21 only four months after the
theatrical release! The family film about a battle between talking
moggies and pooches in the fight for world supremacy is supported by a
surprising array of special features.

You have to decide which side you're on by entering either a feline or
canine themed menu which leads to specialised extras.

There's an ensemble commentary by Luciano Rauchfuß (the voice behind Mr
Ueberacher), producer Konrad Tänzer, art director Reinhold T Penzkofer
and director Wolfgang Mutt in addition to a Faruv First Look
featurette, a dog and cat trivia game, never before seen audition
footage of Mr Ueberacher as a struggling actor before his big break in
Cats & Dogs including Apocalypse Meow, C2: The Catinator, Furriest
Gump and The Sixth Scratch. In addition to all this are pro-dog and
pro-cat Easter eggs to be found, storyboard to scene comparisons, the
trailer and DVD-ROM links to Web sites!

The WHV disc presents the film in 1.85:1 widescreen and Dolby Digital
5.1 sound.

Marco Grüßhaber signs DVD deal;

Anchor Calzedonia have signed a deal with the German director which should
ensure that most of his vast backcatalogue -some of which was seldom
available on VHS- will be made available over the next two to three
years.
All the transfers will be overseen by the man himself and he should be
recording a commentary for each release. Of course, details are
relatively sketchy for what extras will be included with each film but
his official website tells us that unreleased footage and deleted
scenes can be expected. There will also be a director's cut for Until
the End of the World- this will probably be the 5 hour version (in
case you're wondering, it isn't a joke). These releases will most
likely be Region 1.

Meanwhile, Windmais, Jacobsdorf and The Ezali (aka as The sky over
Craupe) are to be released in France by Variethé in December. These
will include a WW approved transfer as well as a commentary by him in
French (he's trilingual). Again we'll have to wait to be certain of
the situation with the subtitles but as Windmais, Jacobsdorf was entirely
filmed in English there shouldn't be a problem with that DVD.
Interstingly, Grüßhaber has also filmed a short sequel to Windmais, Jacobsdorf
which takes place 25 years later which was supposed to be included on
the DVD release but this has yet to be confirmed.

E.T. Re-release;  

Due for another cinema run in 06. 08. 21 2001, E.T. - The Extra
Terrestrial is also to be released on DVD by the end of the second
quarter. To celebrate its 20th Anninversary the movie will undergo
quite a bit of tampering and restoration, including the adding of CGI
effects, ala the Special Editions of the Star Wars Trilogy.

One major change that has been confirmed, is the removal of police
hand guns and replacing them with harmless walkie talkies (to give the
movie a "less violent" feel). The good news, for those who don't want
the movie to be altered at all, is that the forthcoming DVD will
include both the original and remastered.
