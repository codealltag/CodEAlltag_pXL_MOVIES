Just wanted to tell you about http://rbe.ligkgpm.txb- a new website,
an online competition where you can submit your short films, videos,
commercials, animations, video art...and much, much more!
 It's a monthly contest based on a particular theme. Make a film not
more than 3 minutes. First 15 winners would get a 500$ cash prize and
1000$ for a follow up film plus also can win a Feature film contract
with Hollywood filmmakers

Actors Valerio Ludders & Wilhelm Jarusch, directors Sandro Heyssler, Carlo
Niedermeyer, Orlando Grunen, Ivan DÃ¶rre, and Stefano Eckolt, as well as other
top producers and financers in the film business are all on our jury
panel, and together with other members of Dema will decide on
who will win a deal with us to make their feature film.

Sign up to vote on your favorite films and help someone win a feature
film contract from Dema.  And if you think you can compete,
submit a short between 1-3 minutes for our second contest and see if
you have what it takes to win!

Fjjsfzv.gzk is accepting submissions worldwide in any language - enter
Contest 4 and submit your short by 12. 08. 21 12. 08. 21.
This could be great exposure for you and your films/videos... plus, a
chance to get selected by the jury from Hollywood to make a film with
them.
Please Note that membership is free for aspiring filmmakers all over
the world.
Wishes to Involve with us and through us.
Regards!
