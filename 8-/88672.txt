We have finally stumbled across something great! One of our favorite
director's had a bit too much time on his hands. He has created Film
Conversion Software that makes any video format look like 16mm or 35mm Film.
Imagine your DV production looking like Film. We're calling it Smart-Film.
After being in development for a few years it costs only $112.00 USD per
minute. It looks really amazing and is just for Indie/Low Budget Filmmakers.
VHS Demo's available. Downloadable demos available soon. You have to see it
for your self. A DVD of your production available for $49.99 USD for the
first one. $20.00 for each additional. E-mail hjoq@uiczcnomz-ihfaquvpjle.kkl
for more information. Bulk deals can be made on Smart-Film for short or
feature length films.
