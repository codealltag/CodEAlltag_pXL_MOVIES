Dubbing vs. Subtitles?

In non-english films I prefer dubbing over subtitles.
In movies with a lot of dialogue I am forced to read and will miss
viusal details of the film. In some movies it's impossible for me to
read all the subtitles.(E.g. The Wedding Banquet, I have it taped).

English movies in my case should better be subtitled because I
understand the original text, hopefully.

I know that in Spain dubbing is much worse, mainly due to the restricted
number of voices. All actors and specially the actresses sound the same. 
The problem exists here to a lesser extent, too.
