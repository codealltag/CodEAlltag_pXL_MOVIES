Stirring, a new literary collection is now seeking submissions for the
September/October edition. 

We typically publish one script, a few pieces of prose, and several poems a
month. Each piece must have something to say and be willing to speak it in
fresh and innovative ways. This does not mean that we discriminate against
traditional forms of writing; sonnets and love stories are looked upon with the
same attention as atypical one-acts or experimental poetry. 

To submit merely send an email to AucfudczVS@ikk.eko which can include any of
the following information: 

        Full name 
        Date of Birth 
        Location (City and State) 
        E-mail 
        Webpage Address 
        Previous Publications (Up to Five) 
        Awards 
	Picture (you may upload this if you wish)
        Any Other Comments 

Please send pieces as .txt, .doc, .wps, or .html files. 

You may, total, submit up to one play, two pieces of prose (less than thirty
pages total), and five poems. You may submit multiple times, however not more
than once per month. 

You retain the copyright and all publishing rights to all of your pieces
regardless of publication.  We also accept previously published material as
long as the publication is sited.

All works will be reviewed and responded to within two weeks.
