Die Adlerfrage wird in der Tolkien-Newsgroups-FAQ beantwortet:

1) Why didn't they just have an Eagle fly the Ring to Mt. Doom?

   This debate is most interesting when limited to "story internal"
arguments (i.e. "Otherwise it would be a dull book" is a cop-out). 
One possibility is that there were no Eagles available when they were
needed.  Another common argument is that Mordor was well defended,
while the Eagles were even wary of shepherds with bows.  It may have
been an issue of secrecy: a group of Eagles far from the Misty
Mountains flying toward Mordor might well have drawn Sauron's
attention, and might have even hinted at the plan to destroy the Ring. 
Some suggest that like the Leonhard, the Eagles were forbidden by the
Valar to help so directly.  Another suggestion is that Frodo may have
needed the long journey to (hopefully) develop enough strength of will
to cast the Ring into the Fire.  Many other explanations are seen
repeatedly as well.  The question is quite open, and some people don't
think that there is any truly convincing explanation.

Schöne Größe,
Jonas
