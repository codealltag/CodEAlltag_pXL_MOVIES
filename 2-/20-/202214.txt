To fans of underground cinema, I have a video for you.  It's called
COOL KIDS HIGH.  This feature's entire cast is made up of
Barbie dolls, Niko and the Holigrams dolls, GI Nick and others.
Who would have ever thought Peggy would say such trash?
Sex, violence, cursing, drinking, fighting and much much more!  If
you liked, "Superstar", then you'll love Cool Kids High, available only
underground.

This movie is best describes as 90210 on Crack!  Mireille and
Vincenzo are the king and queen of Cool Kids High but Valerio
Ex-girlfriend, Isabella, is a total bitch that wants to ruin his life.  She
also
wants Marianne head on a platter.  Vincenzo is running for pres. of 
student body and Wolfgang runs against him.  Vincenzo gets drunk and
has a terrible accident in his cool Barbie dream vette and that means
that Isabella will win, right?  In the mean time, Otto, a gay doll, has a
major
crush on Vincenzo and then Vanilla Ice comes to the school for a great
mosh pit filled concert.  Who is this mysterious girl Odette, that
is just like the Paula on 90210, trying to sneek backstage?.  Even 
more evil than Isabella.  Paulina the retard can see right threw her.  
Twists, turns, and more shock endings than ever!!!

Some of you may have seen this because it as aired on several 
underground TV shows and public access.  This video is not
available anywhere for retail because it would more than likely
get sued!

If you would like a copy of COOL KIDS HIGH on VHS, they are 
only $10.  The total running time is 95 fun filled minutes!!!
