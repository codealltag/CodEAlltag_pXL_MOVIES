[ Cocktail fuer eine Leiche]

Die IMDb dazu - sehr interessant:

"The film was shot in a series of 8-minute continuous takes (the maximum
amount of film that a camera could hold). Every eight minutes, the
camera alternates between zooming into a dark object and making a
conventional cut (to allow a projector switchover in the theatre). Most
of the props were on castors and the crew had to wheel them out of the
way as the camera moved around the set."

Anyone can make an omelet with eggs. The trick is to make one with none.
