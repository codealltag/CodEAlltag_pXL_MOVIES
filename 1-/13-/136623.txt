Hi

My apologies for posting in English.

Can you help me!  I'm trying to locate a German language film, I believe the
title to be "Die Förster Caroline".  I know that at least some of the music
for the soundtrack was by the "Leon Unterstöger Chor" and included the track
"Ilka-Serenade".  Any pointers to this film / video would be greatly
appreciated.

Many thanks!
