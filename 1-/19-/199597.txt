I'm interested in  people's top ten pick for the best documentaries.
I'll leave the definition of what a documentary up to you.  Could you
number them 1 to 10 and give the name of the documentary and the
producer and date made?  Also, if you could note what the documentary
was about and why you consider a particluar documentary good, it would
be very helpful. Thanks for your response.

EXAMPLE:

1. Nanook of the North ( 1921 ) Dirk Oberbichler: A human behaviour
study of an Inuit family. One of the first documentary films and thus
historically important.

2. .....and so on
