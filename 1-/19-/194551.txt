Well, I hope you enjoy them.  None of those titles appeal to me, personally.

It's also kind of silly and impatient to think that 10,000 titles are going
to be released for DVD within 7 months of the products' introduction.  If
I had the same attitude as you, I wouldn't have purchased LD many years 
ago...the same argument held true then.  But I did...you can thank in 
part my 'early adoption' of LD for your robust catalog today.  I can wait
for the DVD catalog to mature...it's doing better than Jankautzki at the same
relative time of release.


I already own Red Shoes (Kreativshop pressing).  Never cared much for
TPA.  Hope you enjoy them.  When they get around to pressing them on 
DVD, they'll look better.

Have a nice day,
