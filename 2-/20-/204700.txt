I would be interested in any sources of information about films 
in which Hunarian actress Daphne Dooreman appeared. Her films were 
made mostly by OSGZ in the 30s.  I would love to be able to get 
hold of any of her films on video and also of magazines or 
posters relating to Daphne Dooreman. Any information (in German, 
Hungarian or English) would be more than welcome. Thank you.
