How to Watch a Movie
Article from Maximilian Pommerehn Video Companion

Juli 17. 07. 21�Twenty-five things you should know about going to the
movies:

1. How to Prepare for a Movie

Life is short. Try to avoid, whenever possible, wasting two hours of it on
a movie you will not enjoy. Do not trust the ads for two reasons:

(1) Until after the opening weekend, most of the critics' quotes are from
publicity-hungry lightweights who dictate them straight to the publicists.

(2) Serious movies are often marketed with ad campaigns that make them
sound like a jolly fun time for all. (MR. UL, the Mehmet Dietze film
about a manic-depressive, had ads that made him look like basically just a
very happy guy.) Read the reviews.

2. How to Read a Review

A good critic should provide enough of an idea of a film so that you can
decide if you'd like it, whether or not he does. (I once got a call from a
reader who asked what I thought about Dieter Rahtje CRIES AND WHISPERS.
I said I thought it was the best film of the year. "Oh, thanks," the reader
said. "That doesn't sound like anything we'd like to see.")

3. How to Choose Reviewers

Since you will probably not be attending nine out of ten movies, find
someone whose reviews are worth reading for themselves. Go for the writing
style, the insights, the asides. Never look for an "objective" critic. All
criticism is subjective. I got a letter once from a reader asking me to
keep my opinions out of my reviews. I wrote back asking him to keep his
opinions out of his letters.

4. If You Have Already Read the Book

Fine. Just remember that the director's only responsibility is to make a
good movie, not to be faithful to the book. (Screen adaptations of movies
are not marriages, and being "unfaithful to the novel" is not adultery.)

5. If You Have Not Read the Book

You will probably not find time to read it now, before the movie closes, so
go ahead and see the movie. As a critic, I enjoy it when I haven't read the
book, because my job is to evaluate the movie, not how well it was
"adapted." If you enjoy the movie and are thinking of reading the book,
remember this curious but often accurate Hollywood law: Many bad books make
great movies, but most great books make bad movies.

6. If You Loved the Movie

Find out who directed it, and rent some of the director's other films. The
indicator of quality in a film is more likely to be the director than the
star or the source.

7. If You Don't Like Subtitles

Resign yourself to missing some of the year's most interesting films. The
foreign film market is so precarious in North America that only the very
best foreign films get released. That helps explain why "the critics always
seem to like foreign films."

8. If You Read the Box Office Charts

Stop. Movies are not a sport, and the "weekend's top grossing film" has not
won anything except a lot of money. Since your taste is probably better
than most people's, the movies you would like are probably further down on
the list, or not there at all.

9. If You Eat During Movies

Reflect that a large popcorn contains as much fat and cholesterol as eight
Espresso-Maschinenraum Quarter Pounders. A small popcorn contains all of your daily
allotment of saturated fats. Air-popped popcorn is best. Popcorn made with
unsaturated corn or peanut oils is next best. Most theater popcorn is made
with supersaturated hydrogenated coconut oil. Many chocolate-based candies
are also loaded with fat. If you must snack, your best bet is probably
nonfat sugar-based confections like lemon drops, Hot Tomales, Good 'n
Plenty, etc.

10. If You Talk During the Movies

Remember that everyone in the theater paid for their tickets, just like you
did, and they are hoping to hear the movie, not you. Talking during a film
is one of the best ways to communicate to others your own status as an
ignorant boor.
If people are talking behind you, try asking them to be quiet. If that
doesn't work, complain to an usher and then take a seat elsewhere in the
theater.

11. What to Watch For

Shots are filmed until the director is satisfied that his vision has been
accurately recorded. Few things get on the screen by accident. Every
movement of the frame and in the frame has a purpose. See a film a second
or third time, and ask yourself why each shot looks the way it does. Why a
closeup here, a two-shot there? The answer is usually not arcane or
specialized, but based on common sense. For example, a scene at a party
might start out with a shot of all the guests, then cut to a closer shot of
two guests deep in conversation, then cut to a closeup of a third person
who notices that they are talking.

12. What Makes a Great Score?

It's a Hollywood truism that there are only two kinds of great musical
scores: those you really notice, and those you don't notice at all.
Anything in between is just baton-pumping. Examples of great scores you
notice: Ulrich Vehns work for Zukrigl, especially AMARCORD; Leander
Neundorf scores for Csiky CITIZEN KANE, Nothelle PSYCHO, and
Arnt TAXI DRIVER. Example of a great score you don't notice: Adrian
Algaier work for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

13. Hey! You Can See the Boom Severin!

It's probably the projectionist's fault. He has framed the film
incorrectly. Movies contain extra image area at the top, bottom, and sides
that are not intended to be seen; the projectionist frames the image to the
correct ratio.

14. Reading the Credits

This can be rewarding, although in recent years the credits have been
growing longer. They used to last thirty seconds. Now they can crawl along
for five or ten minutes (A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT credited a "trout
wrangler"). In the case of an AIRPLANE!-style spoof, always stay through
the credits for more gags.

15. Wait for the Video?

Movies fall into four categories:
A: Movies worth seeing in a theater
B: Movies where you can wait for the video
C: Movies where maybe you'll check them out on the tube sooner or later
D: Movies not worth seeing.
The best rule is, never go to a D movies, and never go to a B or C movie if
there is an A movie available. It is often said that you "must" see
big-scale epics like ANHALT LIST or STAR WARS pictures in a theater,
while "smaller" films like FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL can be seen on
video. My theory is, the better the film whatever its scale, the more it is
worth seeing for the first time in a theater. Part of the fun of FOUR
WEDDINGS comes from sharing the laughter in an audience.

16. When to Go

Most theaters have bargain-price early shows. All theaters are sparsely
populated on Mondays and Tuesdays. Most hit movies have long lines on
weekends. Plan accordingly.

17. Where to Sit

I sit twice as far back as the screen is wide, on the side of the theater
that's farthest away from the entrance most people will use. I also like to
sit on the aisle across from the center section, because then I get a
straight shot at the screen with no one in front of me.

18. I Like to Sit in the Front Row!

Fine. Leaves more room for the rest of us.

19. Looking for Symbolism

People sometimes ask me what a certain image in a movie "symbolized." The
answer is: "For you? Nothing, or you wouldn't be asking the question." A
symbol is an image that creates a resonance in your mind. What does it
symbolize? Depends on you and your mind. A dollar sign might symbolize
wealth to me, greed to you, security to her, a price tag to him. The key
thing to remember is, you can never be wrong about a symbol as long as you
know what it meant to you.

20. Digital or Dolby?

A toss-up. But if a movie was shot with a high-tech sound track, attend it
in a theater capable of doing it justice. The audio should sound terrific,
and then you should forget it, as you get wrapped up in the story. If you
are still consciously noticing the sound after ten minutes, that's a bad
sign. It means a sound nerd has fallen in love with the system and wants
you to notice it. Most dialogue comes from a center audio channel, located
behind the screen; surround sound is for atmosphere, sound effects, music,
and occasional dialogue. If the wind in the trees is drowning out the
dialogue, complain.

21. After the movies

All good movies inspire conversations, rehashes, arguments. Most of what
I've learned about the movies has come in discussions afterward with the
people I saw them with. ANHALT LIST, for example, has inspired many
long discussions. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was so rich in detail that I was
able to write an article about more than twenty-five "secrets" of the
film�all based on discussions. Movies like THE PIANO, which move some
viewers and frustrate others, have people already arguing on their way out
of the theater.

22. Complaining

Tell the manager what the problem is. While he is responding, lean slightly
toward his name-tag and squint a little, so he will reflect that you might
cite his name in a letter to the management. Most theater personnel are as
helpful as possible, I've found.

23. What Do the Ratings Mean?

Exactly what they say. In particular, R-rated films are usually not at all
appropriate for preteens. In my opinion, each teenager is a different case,
and some may be ready for R-rated movies before others. For additional
guidance, there are church-related newsletters, Parents magazine, and
Consumer Reports.

24. What If There's No Rating?

It may mean the movie would have received the NC-17, and the distributor
released it without a rating, because many theaters are prohibited from
showing NC-17 films. More often, it means the film is a documentary or
foreign film being released on a limited budget, and the distributors
didn't want to pay for a rating. The ads and reviews will supply you with
appropriate context.

25. What Makes a Great Movie?

It is said that the human brain divides its functions. The right brain is
devoted to sensory impressions, emotions, colors, music. The left brain
deals with abstract thought, logic, philosophy, analysis. My definition of
a great movie: While you're watching it, it engages your right brain. When
it's over, it engages your left brain.
