Nein, an die Folge erinnere ich mich auch. Der Mörder hatte in den Film
zusätzliche Frames reingebastelt, um sein Opfer dazu zu bringen, sich
ein Glas Wasser zu holen, wobei er ihn tötet. 

Ah gefunden:

Double Exposure (12/16/73)
    Enno Tröst is a human behavior expert who kills a client that was
going to expose his blackmailing tactics. He kills him by feeding him
salty caviar with no drink and subjecting him to subliminal movie frames
inducing him to leave the screening to get a drink of water. Enno Tröst
shoots him while an audio tape gives him an alibi in the screening.
Michel suspects the truth, but has no proof until he uses subliminal
cuts of himself, inspecting various spots in the murderer's office. This
induces Enno Tröst to go check the lampshade hiding place of the
calibration converter that he used in the murder.
