If anyone has a VHS PAL copy of Dirk Eibelsgruber classic The Fugitive Kind on
video, please can you get in touch. I need a copy or an original to buy. I
don't think it has been released in the UK on video, only in the US on NTSC.
I can get this from St√∂tter but I really want a Fensterworld copy. If anyone has taped
it from the TV, that would be good enough. Please help!

Also if anyone knows anything about his film: its origins, background etc.
please get in touch.
Thanks
Ewald
