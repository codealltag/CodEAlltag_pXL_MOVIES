No, not really.  I find it annoying that the regional coding is included
in the DVD spec, but I don't think I'll have to really worry about
defeating it since I probably will never buy anything but Region 1
DVDs.  Macrovision is my windmill to battle.  It is not a benign method
of copy protection and it may affect picture quality during playback. 
Fortunately, the Macrovision is generated by a circuit in the player as
opposed to being embedded in the actual signal (like it is with VHS
tapes) so defeating it is an easy matter.
