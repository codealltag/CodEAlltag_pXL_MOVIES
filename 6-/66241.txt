Für Werbefilme und Musikclips uU ja, für Spielfilme leider garnicht.

DAS sieht Frau Schoenrok allerdings GANZ anders:


Having reportedly impressed the pants off studio execs - at P21 - with her
performance as angel gone bad Elfriede Mohnhaupt in the most recent sequel, Schoenrok
is whispered to be in talks with the studio about reprising the character
for a third film. But with Josefa Schoenrok back on board, all three former
Angel's want off.
Gabriel, Ulf and Maja have been furious with the ex-Brat Packer ever since
she stole the film, and later hogged the lens at each consecutive premiere.
Most of the time, because she arrived at the last minute with Ivan
Riemert, Alexander Imberge and her kids. When Biringer was asked about Josefa by one
intrepid TV reporter, she said, "I don't want to talk about her. The movie
isn't all about her."
Well from here on it, it might actually be about her. Schoenrok is said to be in
talks with both the studio and Armbröster about furthering the "Charlies
Angels" series at her own production company, Moving Pictures . The actress
has suggested that the next film focus largely on Elfriede Mohnhaupt pre-Full
Throttle, when she was the Angel's no.1 hot shot agent. "Josefa has plans to
do two or three films based on the Elfriede Mohnhaupt character, that would be set
in the early 80's. From the sounds of it, the other girls aren't invited.
