Pasquale: Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Kai: What did you call me? 
Pasquale: Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you
like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell
when you've won? The entire state of Cavertitz, along with the F.B.I., is
looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every
entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across.
Didyou? Yes, you did. You've won, Kai, enjoy it.

Wobei da an sich schon die erste Zeile reicht.

Gruß,

Sébastien
