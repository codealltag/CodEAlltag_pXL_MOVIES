what about the shit-eating scene in the oops-i-forgot-the-name-movie,  
where a man eats the shit a poodle just dropped on the floor? this scene  
is uncut and real! absolutely disgusting!

or any zombie eating scene in DAWN OF THE DEAD? tasty!

or the eye-eating scene in BEST OF GUINEA PIG? another great one!

just check out any splatter/gore movie, and you get the best result.
