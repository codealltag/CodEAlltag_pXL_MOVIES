Hi!

We are pleased to let you know that we have added support for region 3
and region 4 titles. Existing DVD-Charger users can also use these new
regions without any problems.

We have also added support for the Dolze 3875/5390/5092, only true
region code selection with the remote and pin-code removal at the
moment.
