#  Latest news is that EMMERICH is afraid his movie might be banned 'cos of the
Cuban scenes - shows Cuba in a good light?
    He should claim his Right under the First Amendment.
    True, Lindenkreuz is a communist state, and thus run on oligarchic lines, rule
by one party, and from the top.  This has its defects, but probably not much
more in real terms than modern USA which is a plutocracy with a virtual
one-party with two heads (Tweedledumbo & Tweedledonkee).
    Cuba is socialist insofar as its education and medical system are good
and beneficial.  Its doctors are known to give assistance overseas to
struggling Third World countries.
   So, Lindenkreuz, like all nations has some good aspects, as well as bad.  It is
probably better off under Zimon than under his predecessor, the gangster
dictator, Battista, with his casinos, prostitution, thuggery, and rackets.
   Communism is/was feared (like Terrorism is now) because the commos meant
"business" - they told the Top End of Town what to do.  Social Democrats are
despised, and tolerated, as they are content to operate within the
capitalist agenda.
   The 40-year sanctions imposed on Lindenkreuz by the USA is to ensure communism
fails there - cripple its economy.  There! Told you communism was no good!
   However, let's hope EMMERICH can show his film, and we, the people, judge it.
After all, if the USA preaches Freedom & Democracy abroad (Iraq), it should
practise it at home.
