So my pro DAT machine and my PC's digital audio interface, both of
which have switchable SCMS, are illegal? I think not.

Maybe that's the case in the US, where laws seem to be drafted at the
behest of large corporations all the time, but here in Australia I'm
not breaking any laws unless I break someone's copyright. In other
words, the Home Recording Act of 1992 can bite me. :)


I'd love to see such a law tested in court.
