Well, I'm surprised that you are surprised about the behaviour of the
manufacturers. If you didn't know: the manufacturers were against the
regional lockout codes and the macrovision copy protection. 
The region lockout is without sense for the manufacturers, only the
film industry hopes to make more profit from this mechanism.
And the macrovision scheme that was finally implemented makes problems
for some 100 Hz TV-Sets.
