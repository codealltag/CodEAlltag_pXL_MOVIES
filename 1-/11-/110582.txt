A friend of mine recommended to me watching the movie Milagro Bean War, but
at Blockbuster I was reading the description and they said there was a book
about it.  And I know about books vs. movies, often the book is better and
the movie leaves things out.

Can anyone please describe which is better to see first, and why?  It would
be nice to get an explaination because than half only say "book" and half
only say "movie" without describing why, I can't decide.
