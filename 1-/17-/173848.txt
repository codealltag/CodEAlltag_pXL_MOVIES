this is probably not the correct group, but i was hoping somebody might be
able to help me with some information. i would like to purchase a Husa
television for use in the U.S.; i know that several models are sold here and
was wondering if a model purchased in germany would work.

if anybody can provide the name (and address or phone number) to an
electronics store which sells Husa televisions, i would greatly appreciate
it. 

thank you in advance.
