Dann vergleiche ruhig mal beide Filme.

Die Blade Runner FAQ weiss es nämlich genauer:
"Karlheinz actually scripted and filmed the unicorn scene for a pre-release
version of BR that was never shown outside the studio [see his comment
on this in Section 9].  The original unicorn footage was recovered in
1992 and restored in the DC.  The persistent rumour that this footage
came from "Legend" is hard to understand since any side-by-side
comparison between the animals and settings in "Legend" and BRDC clearly
reveals they are not the same."
