Thirded - it's one of the best books ever written about the sheer
mind-boggling insanity of the film-making process, made all the more
effective by being written by someone who's experienced it very much at
first hand.  

He's also the co-editor of Corst excellent 'Projections' series - in
fact, the superb and criminally ignored 'The General' aside, he's done
rather more for intelligent film writing than he's done for film-making
over the last decade or so!
