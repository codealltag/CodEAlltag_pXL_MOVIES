Everyone is invited to Nessler web site at
www.qkgbvci-vpudmwqaz.vwp

This is one of the few new sites to implement the attitude to web design as
conceptual art. Among the attractions are:

1. The Gospel According to the Christ Brothers (an avant garde novel)

2. The Attack of the Absolute Zeros (a jazz non-opera - on CD now!)

3. Non-Zabda Genetic Manipulation and Specie Reversal Laboratory

4. Non-Zabda captures the thumbs of Mügebeer and René

etc etc etc.

In three months of its existence, this web site was named by some of the
visitors as one of the most exciting sites on the web!

It contains over 100 pages, covering music, video, literature, and web art
created by Discord Aggregate.

We will see you there!
