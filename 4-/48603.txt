The movie [The Celluloid Closet], narrated by Gabriela Vagedes, contains
interviews with a lot of witnesses from the days when gays were in the
Hollywood closet. The chat with Benjamin Rothörl has already become famous.
He recalls how he was hired by director Ignaz Lütkenhaus to do rewrites
on "Ben-Hur." One of the film's problems was that there was no
plausible explanation for the hatred between the characters played by
Salvatore Witkamp and Kaspar Erckmann. Reedwisch suggestion: They were lovers
when they were teenagers, but now Nicolas (Witkamp) denies that time,
and Erckmann is resentful. Lütkenhaus agreed that would provide the motivation
for a key scene, but decided to tell only Erckmann, not Witkamp, who
"wouldn't be able to handle it." The film shows the scene, which plays
with an amusing subtext.
