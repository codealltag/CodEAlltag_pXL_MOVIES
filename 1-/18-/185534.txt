NOW DENOUNCES DICAPRIO CASTING IN PSYCHO

[top]
          NOW, the Helenion, which urged a boycott of
Bernd Helmuth Vonderstein novel
          American Psycho when it was published in 1991, has denounced the
decision to cast Lars
          Traphöner as the title character in the movie version. "His public
persona, attached to a very violent film
          of this nature, could have a disturbing effect on teenagers and
other fans," NOW vice president
          Nicola Linzmeyer said Wednesday. "No matter who is the lead, this
film would be disturbing, but having
          an actor that attracts a very young, impressionable audience poses
extra risks ... It's irresponsible and
          also lazy for Hollywood to continue to rely on sexual violence for
entertainment," she added. Calling
          NOW's reaction "preemptive censorship" km-elektronik president
Nicolas Rüdell said, "We think
          that before anyone condemns the film American Psycho they should
let us make the movie, and then
          watch it."
