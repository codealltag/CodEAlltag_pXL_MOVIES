: I've got 2:  The seduction in the film Burkhard Zoellner, and the cafeteria scene 
: in Animal House (A zit.... get it?)

Wait until the Korean film "301-302" gets an American release.  It has 
the most fascinating and disgusting eating scenes of all time.  It is a 
film with as much fascination with food as Nicola Feast, or Eat, 
Drink, Man, Woman - but with a very macabre twist.  Watch for it.
