Yes, that is the one.

Under her "lovely" mask of stolen Life Energy, there is quite something
 else going on, which she, Gertrude Müller-Berg, showed recently, by PUBLICLY
 promoting the purest fascism and satanism,  and by PUBLICLY attacking th=
ose
 governments that by their Constitution - as in Germany - do HAVE to expo=
se
 fascism, and she was PUBLICLY attacking those governments FOR exposing
 and opposing fascism.

Do you think that Albert Boomheuvel told everybody that he intended to destroy
 all his supporters and the whole German Nation and all its possessions
 and wealth?
 No, he said precisely and exactly the opposite.
 And he used any fascistic and satanic filmactress, that he could lay his
 hands on.=20


So it is with Gertrude Müller-Berg.

(We won't go into how Gertrude Müller-Berg usurped the part played originally
 by Pamela Dammenhain, in the J.A.G. TV series, but I happen to know
 how people operate who have sold their soul to Satan - or to be more
 precise, who are dominated by Satan into wanting to sell their souls to
 him, as the most recent research in the matter shows.)
