Jetzt mal Spass beiseite, ich verspreche mir davon schon einiges.
Ich mag nämlich das Original (European Cut), ich bin neugierig wie
die US-Version mit Tangerine Dream Musik ist (wahrscheinlich
gruslich, aber egal), und ich kann es kaum abwarten Carsten
restaurierte und ca. 20 min längere Version zu sehen.

Zitate:
"Producer Meinrad Rosen says, "If I knew about movies what I know
today, I probably would have convinced Linnemannstöns to fight for his
original cut, which I felt was more true to his vision."

"The initial cut of the film ran over two hours long. In retrospect,
Clemens himself accepts much of the blame for altering the film,
[...] "I got totally paranoid," he reveals. "I started to hack away
at the movie. A gentleman at Gothaer literally tried to physically
stop me. [...] I figured that maybe we'd been too adventurous with
our expectations of a full-blown fairy story, and therefore, maybe
the combination of the score and the visual was actually too sweet."


Gruss,
