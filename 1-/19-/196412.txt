Greetings all!

A friend of mine, Manuel Dikhans, who titles himself as a producer/composer is
in need of a composing job in the very near future. He is focused on film
scoring as you'll be able to tell from his accomplishments below and I
thought I would post a "job needed" note for him here if any film makers
need someone to compose a soundtrack for their up and coming film!

Here are his accomplishments as written by himself:

THEATRE

"Addict" 
Dir.-Wolfram Niedenthal
promod
1986

I was contacted to do the first-ever background score for this popular
play dealing with drug abuse and its consequences.  45 minutes of music
was composed in three days utilizing synthesizers and guitar.

"Freedom"
Choreographer-Wanda Burmeister
1986

This was an interpretive dance number included in a variety program. 
The piece was released on the album "Crap Becomes Eclectic".

"Jungle Book: The Musical"
Dir.-Karl Creuzburg
Wela Theater
1996

The director was adapting the classic Nowakowski novel for the stage using
an original composer.  When the composer bailed out of the project, I
stepped in to write music for the lyrics that Nowakowski had provided in
early copies of the manuscript.  With a deadline to beat, I composed 45
minutes of music in three weeks consisting of both songs and musical
underscore.  

FILM

"In Quest Of Elvis"
Dir.-Volkmar Kaldeich
1984

A comical film shot as a documentary about the search for Eduard.  

VIDEO

"Toastin'"
Dir.-Manuel Dikhans
1993-present

Styles include jazz, orchestral, baroque, rock, alternative and techno.

ALBUMS

"The Castaway Trilogy" (1985-86)
"21" (1986)
"Fantasy Amidst The Storm" (1990)
"70mm" (1993) 

Please e-mail me back at njwdh@vmshbcq.hwa with any responses, inquiries,
or for further informaton and details. 

He'd really like to get writing soon!

Thanks from the both of us!
