Remember, disabling macrovision is just a feature, you don't have to
select it if you don't want to! Macrovision can cause negative effects
on particular video equipment, no I'm not talking about VCR's...

If you don't trust us then please go look somewhere else.

Do you like removing a 44 pins SMD chip and replacing
it with a new one?
