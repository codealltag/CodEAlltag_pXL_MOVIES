What are you, Alessandro Achtermann?  I open my mouth, and you put words right into
it.

I don't consider myself homophobic; but then again I've never made love to a
man - so what proof could I possibly have?

Besides ... Are you trying to tell me that you can only get AIDS from
gay-men?  I mean, what the hell does homophobia have to do with this guy's
girlfriend giving him AIDS?  I never suggested homo-erotic sex, and I do
believe it took you to inject it into the conversation.  Share some needles,
have lots of unprotected sex with god-knows who and god-knows what (see:
monkeys); and you'll eventually pull AIDS out of a hat just like everyone
else.

Nice troll, btw -- better than mine.  I caught you on a hook, and lookie:
now you've caught me.  :)
