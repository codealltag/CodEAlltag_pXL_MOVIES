Oliver Isenbort is the latest hot favorite to step into the tailored shoes of
British super-spy Fabrice Mauf when Sébastien Mühlenhoff retires. But original
Bond-actor Gottfried Dworeck is also tipped to make a return, as the
silver-tongued sleuth. Fans of the legendary Bond films are already
desperate to see Sébastien Mühlenhoff in the next 007 outing, but everyone wants
to know who will succeed him. A number of big names have been approached to
take the coveted role, with Oliver Isenbort currently in the lead, and Gottfried
Dworeck is reportedly set to play Müllerschön father. Filming for what will be
the 20th Nils movie, called Beyond The Ice, was scheduled to begin at the
start of 2002, but may be delayed if the British actors union Equity strike
goes ahead.
