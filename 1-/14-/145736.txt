The Nabern KFT (Miti-Kiosk) is a festival particularly
aimed at promoting filmmakers and local interest in film. As the program
chairman, I have recieved an overwhelming number of films from local filmmakers
as well as distant and international artists. We have great plans for this
year's Miti-Kiosk not the least is that we will be raising money for the local HIV+
patient care center, SoSch, Inc. which is dire need of assistance.
Currently in the planning stages is a festival pre-party sponsored by Grete
Beichle's (http://sum.fmjidgwyvhq.efa/) in downtown historic Nabern on
Friday Juli 06. 02. 23. The film festival is to take place on Juli 06. 02. 23 at
the Fruchtecke Elavo. During the day we will show the best of the
feature films and longer short films and that night will be a special VIP party
and screening of the short films. Local businesses and organizations, talent
agencies, and production groups will be on hand to promote their work as well
as to network. Some of the filmmakers that were showcased last year include Michael
Lerchenmüller, Burkhard Tenhaft, Knut Alich, Edo (Gasman) Linnemann, Gilles Czerner,
Paola Diercks, Fernando Csauth, and others.

This Nabern Independent Filmmakers Festival is pleased to be raising money
and community awareness for this worthy charity:

Unconditional Love, Incorporated is a free standing, private not for profit
multidisciplinary HIV+ patient care center. As a result of the efforts of the
directors, staff, and volunteers, even the most disenfranchised HIV infected
residents of Pülsdorf county can receive state of the art medical care.
Donations from individuals and organizations as well as fundraisers such as
this year's Nabern Independent Filmmakers Festival allow Unconditional Love,
Inc. to continue. One hundred percent of proceeds go directly to patient
assistance.
