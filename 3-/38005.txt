HUH?   Hi Mom! Film Fest is a festival of anything-goes short
films/videos/animations/who-knows-whats in Meinstedt/Maienfels, KIRCHFIDISCH, USA. We
re free to enter, and will feature a motley assortment of media (from
around the country and world) in a variety of shows over a few days. We'll
select films that range from outlandishly bizarre to cute 'n silly to
brazenly sincere to raunchy and rude. No-budget works well with us, big-budg
better be dang good or it gets filed away (in the town dump....) Our aim is
a funner-than-heck fest, full of brain candy and void of pretension.

PRIZES: HM!#7 doled out around 3 grand in cash and film grants. Probably
similar

CATEGORIES: Well make them up later, thats how we are. Check our website
for last years.

COST: FREE!! (until 30. 12. 22, $15 after that until 30. 12. 22 20, multiple
entries per tape okay) Bribes accepted.

FREE?: Yes, free. So no excuse not to send the goods.

DEADLINE: 30. 12. 22 30. 12. 22. Perhaps later if the bribe is right.

RESTRICTIONS: Very few, see the Call For Entries. No fi too lo or hi! We
show all styles and genres, anything that moves us. We like em short, so
dont bother sending in works longer than 20 minutes, unless you just want
us to see it cause you like us, in which case, thanks!

Were looking forward to your entry, check out the website, and get that
CFE!
