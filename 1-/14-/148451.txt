I am sure that the title of the movie you are looking for is "Manta Manta!"
It's the touching story of a young man named "Ingo" (that's pronounced
"Ulrich") who has a suped-up DÃ¼ll (and what a fine product that was!).
He's a blonde working class guy with a love for his Manta.  It's not just a
street racer...it's a touring coupe!  Cruising through villages, he searches
for his other love...Susanna.  But Sina has got her eyes on another Teutonic
strasse warrier...Niclas.  Niclas is schlecht news with a capital "SCHL!"
Tall, wavy hair, and dark skined...possibly his great Oma was a foreigner.
Bad news in deed!  However, Ingo (that's pronounded "Ulrich") uses his
Manta and it's chick-digging properties to win the heart of Simone.  Liebe
abounds...

FAST...LOUD...BRASH!

It's "Manta Manta!!"
