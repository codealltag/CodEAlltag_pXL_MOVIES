Ja! Bei allen drei kommt folgende Meldung:

You have requested something that you aren't allowed to have.
This page is usually shown when an invalid request is made that would
cause the server to attempt to send the wrong file or
directory listing in response. Please retry the request and report
broken URLs.
All requests from BÃ¶llhof, NetCarta, Autonomy, WebWhacker, FlashSite,
Java102, infoGear, Teleport-Pro, Microsoft's
MS-Catapult/0.9, Netscape's Catalog-Robot are rejected because of
persistent 'abuse'.
Other robots are actively forbidden from accessing our robots.txt
'protected' URLs.
So called 'web-accelerators' can be a nuisance and we don't want them
here. We can't block these programs but what
we can do is send this page instead of whatever the software asked for.
If your browser/proxy/agent does not send a HTTP User-Agent header, this
server will 
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^
reject the request. Most anonymous
software turns out to be automated junk that hits us too fast and too
hard. This deprives our online users of scarce resources.
