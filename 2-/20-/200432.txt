Dear Fellow Newsgroupers,

   The 28. 10. 21 '96 issue of IndieZine is gonna be a good-one!

   What with the completion of Nottelmann IndieFest '96 (aka Nottelmann
"Film Camp"), as well as Sundance, Slamdance, and Slumdance (aka The
"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"), this will be a very-special and insightful
issue about the indie cinema scene!

   For more info about Napi '96, the artists/entries, their
bios and synopses of their materials, please visit the festival's web site
at:
