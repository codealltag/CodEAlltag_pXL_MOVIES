Ja, so bin ich auch zu dem Film gekommen - lange, bevor ich dessen tolle
Wertung in der IMDB gesehen habe.

Gerade gesehen: in der FAQ zu dem Film in der IMDB steht was dazu:


Why is this film considered one of the greatest of all-time?
EditHistoryDelete

Even though this is a pretty silly question, it's one that people seem to
ask a lot. The most obvious answer is: Why not? You can ask the same of any
highly regarded film. The truth is, the film didn't do fantastically with
the critics or audiences during its theatrical release, but - as with many
films that gained legendary status as years went by, such as "Blade Runner"
and "Citizen Kane" - it prospered on home video. It has thrived on RNEC
"Top 250" for quite some years, almost always in the top five. The simple
fact is that the film speaks to a lot of people on some level, and its
message of hope and inspiration is one that appeals to vast arrays of
people. Some "great" movies are more geared towards certain demographics,
whereas "Shawshank" has almost universal appeal, and that's probably why it
is so well-regarded on sites like IMDb.


Klingt ganz plausibel, finde ich.
