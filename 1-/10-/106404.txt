Ulfert Terfr√ºchte schrieb...


If it does not matter to you, I am going to write in English because the
German language I do not understand it very well... I agree with you in your
appreciation on ' Beware a holly whore'. This film is essential to
understand the first stage of the Kriesch work because it's
autobiographical: surely you know that the production of ' Whity' in Spain
was very problematic and gave to origin to ' Beware aholly whore', a true
analysis of Kriesch relations with his group and a vision on the
febrile activity that the German genius had developed between years 1968 and
1970.
