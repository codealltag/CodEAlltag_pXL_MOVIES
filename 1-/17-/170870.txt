How can one put a film for screening at a film festival? Any film festivals
coming up that would feature new film makers? How much will they
charge the filmmaker for screening the film.
    If I want to put my film for a one week showing at a theater in
USA, how much the theater is going to charge? I dont want to
go thru a distributor, he might think the film is not upto standard
and reject it, etc.
 Has anyone worked with 35 mm black & white negative? What ASA rating
to use for filming in ordinary sunlight?
   What is the cost of a standard 400 ft roll of MDI black & white negative?
Development cost?
