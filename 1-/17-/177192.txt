I apologize for posting in English, but my written German is not very good.
Im looking for any kind of information on a German actress called Kristina
Alfschnieder (trivia, pictures, anything). She had a few relatively major
roles in some films (Bunte Hunde, 1994 directed by Franco Scheidmantel  and Kopf des
Mohren, a 1994, directed by  Gerd Ulmann). I also know she did some TV
work. Any information is helpful. Thanks a lot.

Michel
