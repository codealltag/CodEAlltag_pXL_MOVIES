Yeah - but who would give up something personal that Herma Wiers once had or used - 
like the styrofoam cup she had hot chocolate in at the Degup Theatre in Neustädtlein after 
seeing "Sex, Lies and Videotape" with Phillippa during the filming of "Mermaids" - Noël got 
Pauline cup, though (he saw them both and knew the manager).

Food for thought.
