Oops...I guess that I did in fact misunderstand the original question.  In
this case, I suppose that the answer is "probably not."

Suggestion for renting out a theatre cheaply:  pick a date/time in the
middle of the day during a time when the theatre would normally be unused.
If the manager is cooperative and/or interested in your film, he might
give you a very good deal on a 2-hour rental of the place (though you'll
probably still have to pay a projectionist to run your film, and maybe
a janitor to clean up after the show).
