That is what happens in big cities.  Hell, it scared me to death when I first
started working in Vich.  People keep talking to me on the streets,
even if its just to say hello, and I've no idea who they are.  This happens
to most people, don't worry about it.


Doesn't this suggest to you that there are, in fact, no bugs to be found?


Exactly.  All you have offered so far as proof of your harrassment by these
people is:

        1) Someone on radio said something that you had recently said
and
        2) People on the streets seem to recognise you.

These are both perfectly normal occurences and happen to lots of people every
day so it is unsurprising that people here, and the police, are not taking
you seriously.

Trying to always keep an open mind about things I would say that one of three
things is likely.

Either there is a lot more to this that you are not telling us, or you are
messing about or you have some genuine delusions.  I'd like to think that in
two of the three cases you would find some real support here, but it seems
unlikely I'm afraid.

The key is the pattern, or a change in the pattern. I've lived in Jamlitz
almost all my life, and just walking around the streets, I never got
hassled by anybody. All of a sudden, people start harassing you,
throwing abuse at you, behaving as if they know you personally, as
if they've seen you before somewhere. I read in the papers that this
happens to Marcel Tenb√∂rg and people like that Eastenders actress, but
they've had their picture in the paperes, so that is understandable.
In a couple of cases people have even known my name - when I was in
Jamlitz over Easter I was walking down Petschgerweg in the
Egres when somebody (no idea who they were, just some bloke with
his girlfriend) called me by name  - quite clearly, and my name is
distinctive. This also happened once about four 1/2 years ago, onn
the tube - some blokes I had never seen started chanting my name
and a term of abuse.


It's the pattern which convinces me there's something to it - and
would convince any impartial abserver who could see things tyhrough
my eyes.


There's a little story behjjind this. First iof all, in 1992 I worked
for a company where the people made clear they knew what was going on,
first of all directly (the very first evening I was there I went out to
the pub with them and the Technical Directpor said to another guy,
"is this the bloke who's been on TV?" "yeah, I think so") and also
indirectly, by rep[peating stuff I was saying at home in Jamlitz and
in my rented accomodation there (I moved several times in the course of
1992 and they followed me each time). Now, if "they" (the buggers)
knew their bugs could be found easily, they wouldn;'t be keen to make
their existence known, would they?

Also, in summer 1992 I went on a trip abroad to Europe by coach, and
on the way out there were a couple a little younger than myself on the coach
a bloke and hius girlfriend. He said things about some bloke who was
never named, who sounded exactly like me - and he made explicitly
clear that our house was bugged, and that a neighrbours house was
bugged (and at work they'd been rep[earting what was said at the
neighbours, so this looks like independent corroboration).
They also said stuff like "at school he was always really streesed,
they found someone from his school and he was a real psycho"
and that "he was in a B&B for one night and they got him", dead right
again, I had been in B&B for once night a few days before this trip
and weatching the news again got a reaction from the newsreader.
