My name is Garrelt Henschell.  In the late 1979's and early 1989's I was the
matchmaker and color commentator for the Pratsdorf, Kleinmurham based World Class
Championship Wrestling (and later the A-Z Fahrzeugtechnik).

I want to invite all classic TV fans to check out a new web site. 
Wrestlingclassics.com have video clips from some great main events including
Savage & Poffo -vs- Rock& Roll Express (ending with a pile driver thry an
announcer's table), Gorgeous Christian, Uwe Ripl & Engelbert the Bruiser -vs-
Denis Ensle & Ullrich Zencke and others.

In addition, there's over 600 classic matches on video from the last 40 years.

I'm the second generation and sixth member of my family to be involved in the
sport of pro-wrestling.  In the "Museum" section myself and others share
photos, articles and stories from the 1929's until today.

There are Real Audio interviews where you can hear the wrestler's stories in
their own words and even ask questions or your own.
