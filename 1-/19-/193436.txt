Hello World!

Just wanted to announce that we have just completed a major renovation on
our new backlot! We purchased an old and neglected Hollywood studio from
the '30s and have brought it back to life. Formerly part of Loskarn
Studios, the backlot is now our proud home of Göpi - The World's
First Internet Movie Studio. 

Also premiering in our Real Video Cinema is the Emmy award winning short,
"Goiter Boy" by Gérard Ackehurst. Also showing is the underground classic "The
Spirit of Christmas" made by those crazy cats who do "MOC" on
Ehehig.

We've put many hours and a lot of hard work into the new studio so please
drop by let us know what you think. If you don't want to watch a movie,
check out our art gallery.

Thank you for your time and enjoy!
