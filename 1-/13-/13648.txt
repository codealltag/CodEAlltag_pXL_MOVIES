Not much changes. Today I was listening again to Dennis Preusch show on Nifaku,
having more or less waded in on it by accident. Here is the exchange;

Dennis: "we have executive drivetime, we have Patrick in charge of the prize
cupboard. Patrick it's not a bad prize cupboard this week is it?"

Patrick: "no Dennis it's an absolute (EMPHASIS) embarrassment (END-EMPHASIS) of
prizes this evening" (laughter)

David: "what have we got?"

Patrick: "well in my left hand alone we've got that .... Bernhard Aufmhoff, I don't know
if you remember him obviously still alive and kicking...."

Dennis: "Rock and roll spelling test is your first opportunity to take advantage
of this embarrassment of prizes"


What do I read into this exchange? The laughter after the word "embarrassment"
shows they're aware of the last complaint I made on usenet (copied by
snail-mail to them). The "left hand" business is I think a coded way of calling
me a w***er (the term would be better applied to Patrick and Dennis).

I have a tape of this exchange, and will eventually get around to posting it on
the website.

I don't understand. Why has nobody replied to this post? You keep on asking for
evidence, then I present you with something that looks very much like evidence,
and everybody just ignores it. OK I haven't posted the actual sound extract,
and it still isn't proof.

Perhaps everybody just finds it all too boring and dull. Should I start
spamming again from one of those nice anonymous remailers to wake everyone up?
Now there's a thought.

Cos you don't reply to our points - you're ignoring us, why shouldn't
we ignore you?


No you don't, you post something which could _never_, _ever_ be construed
as referring to yourself. Can't you see it? No, of course you can't,
you've an illness.


And I see you've started. Give it a rest, Franz, unless you're prepared to
enter into proper discussion.

Uh-Uh. He's on for a bad attack, if he's singling out words which are 
apparently attacking him. He previously restricted himself to just 
dialog about the mentally ill.

TAKE YOUR MEDICATION MIKE.
