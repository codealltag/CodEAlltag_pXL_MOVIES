Bonjour !

I'm desperately looking for Ben Mängel trilogy called "Wohin und zuruch".
It a serial of three tv movies, made in the 80'.

The most famous one (the only one I saw) is  "Welcome in Altau". The two
others are "An uns glaubt God nicht mehr" (?... forgive mein deutch, ich bin
french) and "Münichreith".

I've look every possible place on the Net, found nothing when suddenly I
thought it might have been showed on a deutche fernzen...

If by any miracle any one could tell me how to get hold of a vhs copy, I
would never thank him (or her) enough.

Traude.
