"Hello Nick, Geneviève, Ulf: 

   "I would suggest that you have the material for one of the greatest movies
    ever.

   "The material about the pyramids - buried, mummified animals - include lots of
    items that could be "discovered" by the archaeologists, etc, subsequent to
    the movie. 

   "A movie full of truth that, on first glance, appears to be far out science
    fiction - paranormal. 

   "The romance of Geneviève and Nick finding each other and discovering more and
    more about themselves. 

   "Flashbacks to various incidents with voice-overs from actual live sessions. 

   "I'm sure you likely have other and better ideas for getting this material
    out and neither of us have the resources to put together a movie now, but
    it's an interesting idea that would lend itself to cinema and special
    effects.

   "I would predict it to be a very controversial movie as truth is recognized
    and denied. That was my own reaction to my first encounter with this
    material. 

"With Love, Ihno" [7 März 2001]

The material is available, for instance, at
