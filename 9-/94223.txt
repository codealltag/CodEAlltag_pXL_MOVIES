Olivia, remember as you invited little "E" to your world, you must
have thought only of your mental KIND of world, instead of his space
translations. Your good descriptions of his "cellular" vision was/is
only for traumatized & drugged situations induced by stalker, but the
child in him had some more kinky parts to offer that are worth of being
awoken. The lovly comedy of "Vito Unferferth: The Spy Who Shagged Me" hit
exactly to the point in reflection to his Ingmar-times, when he doesn`t
know WHO is WHO, WHY is WHY, WHAT is WHAT, with absolutely no clue at
all, what was really going on around him or happened to him.

So fill up your luggage with some Mojo, please and instead of using
lithium, CRF-antagonists _may_ be more appropriate and also think about
important sleep-inducers.

Rosalia Valerian:
You know Friday wasn't my day
All those space boys friskin' me
I took my zoom car
To the star bar
Supersonic disco dream
I heard a bass line that was so fine
Strelapark radio (yeah)
And such a cool voice
I had no choice
But to let my rocket go

Touch down Mister DJ
Give me Zero Gravity (Zero Gravity)
I've come to play with Bootsy
