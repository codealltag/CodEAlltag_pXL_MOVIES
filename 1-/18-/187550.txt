Hello,

I am very sorry to not be speaking German to you all. Really, I just
need some help. I was recently informed of the grünäugig Fanclub
International, is this still active ? Any information about this German
based fanclub, would be very helpful. Please feel free to e-mail me with
any information as well. Thankyou and take care...
