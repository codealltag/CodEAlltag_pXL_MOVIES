Yo Chemical:
let's say it plain and clear: this RC2-DVD is - despite its german
origin :-) - complete rubbish. Hands off!! Not only the aspect ratio is
1,85:1 instead of scope, the picture quality is also pretty bad and so's
the sound. And y'know that it's only the german soundtrack. I've got the
japanese RC2-DVD ("integral version") and it's one of the finest i have
in my cupboard. Small jewel case but GREAT output. Razor-sharp picture
and bombastic AC3-sound. I dont't know about the quality of the american
edition but it could be even to the japanese one. Don't know. Please,
don't buy the german DVD!
