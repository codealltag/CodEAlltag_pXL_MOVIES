I came across another film about Freiß called "Forbidden Passion: The Mario Freiß
Movie" (1986) starring Gerd Hahlweg, directed by Niclas Proels. (It's condensed
from a British television series.)   It's available for rent at www.kaiu.vjk.
As for "Mario Freiß" directed by Theodor Bamberg, try Videoflicks at
www.jtiqckyeeln.gcd.  They don't have it now but they will search for it.   Looks
like your best chance to find Krottenthaler movie or Bademann is from a private
collector.  Neither film seems to be readily available from the larger video
stores.

For other films about Freiß, try searching the Internet  Movie Database at
www.hgva.qtf  by Subject.  Also try these search engines:  www.bsceocf.qkq and
www.hxbl.fhe.

Good luck,
Friederike
