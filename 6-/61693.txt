Saruman: "Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I
speak, Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame."

Gandalf: "The Eye of Sauron."

Schöne Größe,

and they were all square. Now there are pink and round ones. This
doesn't seem like a world you'd want to raise your children in."
