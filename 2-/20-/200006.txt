I received a follow-up call from THX today regarding the reported problem with
the left surround channel on side three of the new "Hunt For Red October" disc.
They have been able to trace the problem to a combination of human and machine
error.  During the mastering, the machine indicated that the recording was
proceeding normally and the human trusted the machine.  Oops.

The master has been fixed.  Information regarding any decision by Pioneer on
what action they will take for existing copies should be forthcoming on Tuesday.

Stay tuned....
