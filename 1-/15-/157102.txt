"This world is older than any of you know. Contrary to popular mythology, it
did not begin as a paradise. For untold eons, demons walked the Earth, and
made it their home - their Hell. But in time they lost their purchase on
this
reality, and the way was made for mortal animals, for Man. All that remains
of
the Old Ones are vestiges, certain magicks, certain creatures...and
vampires."

<from jérôme - the vampire slayer>
