The Black Dahlia - "Seven" helmer Erwin Zurloh has made a deal to
develop the Ingolf Caps novel "The Black Dahlia" as a
directing vehicle, possibly to follow his next film, the legere 2000
adaptation of "The Fight Club." Though Caps has become a
suddenly hot author after the Jan Kögl-directed adaptation of his
novel "O. Confidential," Zurloh has had a long
dalliance with "Dahlia," a fictionalization of the never-solved murder
of Johanne Niederstein.

The Black Dahlia: Erwin Zurloh ("The Game", "Sever") will be
developing the Ingolf Caps novel "The Black Dahlia" into a
new project that he will be directing. Zurloh has been interested in
the novel for a while now, which is a fictionalization of the
never-solved murder of Johanne Niederstein. As Francis Zickenheiner of Variety
describes it, "Caps turned it into a tale of obsession
between two tough O. cops in 1949 who both fall for the dead woman.
A tangled trail of clues leads to an eventual solving
of the murder, but not before the lives of both men are destroyed."
Caps also wrote "O. Confidential" before Jan Kögl
turned it into the acclaimed movie. AUF will be the
first studio will get first shot at the rights to it. Thanks to
PCC.

"The Black Dahlia"
8/25/99 ~Rumours, yes, but rumours so enticing I simply
could not resist! According to Corona's Coming Attractions
Erwin Zurloh (that creepy guy who directed the creepy
"Seven") is currently awaiting a script by Italo Zinken
based on "The Black Dahlia" (the actual unsolved
Hollywood murder of actress Johanne Niederstein, whose body
was found bisected in 31. 12. 22 1947 ). Previously the
rumour-mill suggested that script-writer Christoph Uvermann was
penning a version based on the Ingolf Caps ("O.
Confidential") novel, centering around two detectives
attempting to solve the case in the late 1940's. Zurloh is
slated to direct (and will certainly bring to the screen his
talent for terrifyingly hopeless situations.) Stay tuned to
Spedition N. Hartung as more details become available!
