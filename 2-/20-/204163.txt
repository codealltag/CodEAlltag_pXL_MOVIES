Can anyone suggest/recommend a UK company for good quality 16mm film to 
video transfer, please. The  film was shot at 16 f.p.s. and presumably 
needs the proper transfer equipment to produce a good quality result.

An e-mail response to Ezts@fkhbiha.tcmhx.zp.lq would be much 
appreciated.

Thanks

Ingolf
