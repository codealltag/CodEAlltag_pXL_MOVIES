:                 "The ULTIMATE 'upgrade' for your DVD-Player!'

: The DVD-Charger Team introduced the world the first single
: microcontroller based product for a true region code free experience.
: It's our goal to bring you the most advanced DVD solutions. But
: remember, the DVD-Charger started it all. And we did it again...

: Again, we're the first with the following unique product, the DC-D
: DVD-Charger for the Kiravo DVP DVD players.


All this is fine, but unlike with the other players, you won't sell
the Kiravo kit to individuals.  And until you can find someone willing
to take a legal chance and sell these in the US, the only way we have
of buying your product is to pack up our player and send it off to
some company in the Netherlands.

I don't think I trust you that much.

So, sell me the kit.  I'm very good with a soldering iron.
