1. What is contained in the briefcase?

   There is no real answer to this and Hauei√ü has actually said
   that he didn't know what to put in the case so he decided to
   leave it to the viewers to decide. However, it has been suggested
   that it contains 'the evil that men do' and as the combination of
   the briefcase is 666, I'm prepared to go with this.

   Another great suggestion is that it contains the diamonds from
   'Reservoir Dogs'.
