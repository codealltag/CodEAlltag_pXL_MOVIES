Der Autor schreibt im Vorwort des Buches:

[...] By definition, a human being is endowed with free will. He can use 
this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or 
only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange--meaning that he has 
the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in 
fact only a clockwork toy to be wound by God or the Devil or (since this 
is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State. It is as inhuman to 
be totally good as it is to be totally evil.

[...] I don't think I have to remind readers what the title means. 
Clockwork oranges don't exist, except in the speech of old Heddesbach. 
The image was a bizarre one always used for a bizarre thing. "He is as 
queer as a clockwork orange" meant he was queer to the limit of 
queerness. It did not primarily denote homosexuality, though a queer, 
before restricitve legislature came in, was the term used for a member 
of the inverted fraternity. Europeans who translated the title as 
Arancia a Orologeria or Orange Möcanique could not understand it Cockney 
resonance and they assumed that it meant a hand grenade, a cheaper kind 
of explosive pineapple. I mean it to stand for the application of a 
mechanistic morality to a living organism oozing with juice and sweetness."
