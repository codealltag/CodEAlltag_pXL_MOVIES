In Eleonore dream sequence, the Eveline De-Fehr in the playground was
played by Therese Ohrtmann twin sister, Trudy Offenbeck Gearren. The
scene was originally to be shot with Therese playing both parts but she
suggested using Trudy to make it easier to shoot. Trudy was
subsequently used as a double in other scenes involving two "Eveline
Duenbostell" (i.e., when the T1000 was imitating her).

Identical twins Walter Attenkofer and Willi Attenkofer played  the hospital
security guard and the T1000.
