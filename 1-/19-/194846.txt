Just think what we'll hear when HDTV software becomes available..."HDTV
isn't as good as laserdisc because there are over 10,000 movies on LD
but only a handful of movies on HD-DVD." I'm sure a "And you can't get
any of the special editions on HD-DVD like you can with laserdisc"
wouldn't be far behind.

If the improved image quality and lack of side-changes on DVD have been
received this poorly by certain groups already, just think how much
*worse* it will be when an even better alternative becomes available:

"...And you have to buy a new TV to get the full benefit of HDTV...no
thank-you...I'll stick with laserdisc!...why invest in a new format when
we already have one that meets our NTSC/interlaced/composite needs?"
