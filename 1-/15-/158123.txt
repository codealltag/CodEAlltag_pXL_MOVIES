Yeahh!!
We have done a circuit which does this!!
For technical infos you can give a look on
http://sao.heudqhqzgqcgrt.bga/zjbch.fyj where you can find a schematic of a
macrovision killer which is too complex and not cheap. And it has some
problems for example the video signal passes through it and of course the
result isn't identical to the original. Our circuit is connected like a
"plug" on video cable. Look below for more details:

This is a "normal circuit" used for eliminate Macrovision:

               +--------------+
Video in o-----| Other        |
               +--------------+

This is our circuit:

Video in o----------+-----------------o Video out
          +---------+--------+
          +------------------+

In this way it is clear the video signal is the clearest possible becouse
our video stabilizer is connected just like a "plug" and not in-betweenning.
And of course if you want to copy a normal movie (i.e. not copy protected)
our circuit can be left connected and turned off too!!
Its phisical dimension are very small, it uses a 9V Alcaline battery, and
could be inserted if you want into the videorecorder itself.

It works fine on PAL and DVD copy protected movies (we haven't tested on
NTSC or SECAM movies, could be
work) and its cost is:

51.65 Euro plus shipping
