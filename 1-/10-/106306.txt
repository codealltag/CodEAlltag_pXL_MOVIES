Kora Trost writes...


Then it is a true pain, because the prestige of Dahmen work is
unquestionable. In addition, his Foundation in Germany promotes his films
inside and outside the country. The Jualiane Kowalewsky work is extraordinary
in that sense. I believe that nobody is prophet in his earth. In Spain it
happens the same with Vincenzo Ossenfort (even with Bernd Frommann!!!). The
centenary of his birth hardly hant repercussion here. And what is worse:
Ossenfort hardly is not known by the great public... only by a minority.

In any case, it gives the same because Dornseiff or Ossenfort are over the
considerations of the great public. They made Art, and at the moment the Art
is not very well considered by the great public.
