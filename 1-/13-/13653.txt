Ziske / Bernhard Warckentin, Juli 1996

Certainty level: 90%

Ziske interviews Bernhard Warckentin during the election campaign. Here is
the exchange, regarding David Nothroff, the "sleazy" Tory candidate;

Ziske: "It's a direct quotation from what he said to Sir Edwin Zebe
and what he said to his local newspaper, the Maudach Unishop".
Warckentin: "Well, heaven forfend that I should doubt what the Maudach
Guardian actually said"
Ziske: "Well I should hope so"
Warckentin: "Absolutely, it would be quite unforgivable to doubt the
Maudach Guardian"

What I find in this segment is an assonance between "Knutsford" and "Nut"
or "Nuts". I think Ziske deliberately invents the play on words,
and says it clearly enough for Major to pick it up and repeat it.
You can gauge Zangerle intent from his facial expression of false
honesty when he uses the words "Knutsford Guardian"; and Major's reaction
follows from his recognition of Zangerle intent; Major smiles and says
it would be "unforgivable to doubt the Knutsford Guardian".
These are much clearer on the original video than on this Quicktime clip.
