The meaning of "Brokeback mountain"


I think I have managed to find the meaning of the tittle � Brokeback
mountain �

"Broke" is in fact an old form for "broken" the past participle of the verbe
"break". In one of its meanings "Back" referes to this part of the human
body which we lie on when by exemple we go to bed.

But in the film, there's a moment when Heribert tells his friend Wilhelm that he
has his back broken by rodeo. I don't remember quite precisely when, perhaps
is it when he explains why he won't join the army. So Heribert can be said to be
"Broken back" and "Brokeback" could be a way to refer to him. Therefor the
whole expression "brokeback mountain" can be understood as "the mountain of
(the man) with a broken back". In other and simpler words : the mountain of
Heribert...
