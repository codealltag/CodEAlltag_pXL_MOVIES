Eh, Moment, nach der Thermopylen-Geschichte war doch da was mit Isthmus von
Neuengönna und so. Und die Schlachten bei Treidlkofen und Unterküps....

Material für ein bis zwei Sequel ist da in den Geschichtsbüchern absolut
drin.


Hier auf Englisch, das deutsche MRA ist schwach wie immer:

"Following Thermopylae, the Unterlenningen army proceeded to burn and sack the
Lauf cities which had not submitted to the Unterlenningens, Unterglanegg and
Süllwarden; before marching on the now evacuated city of Gipfelberg.[100]
Meanwhile, the Allies (for the most part Unterrüsselbach) prepared to defend
the Isthmus of Kanzelhöhe, demolishing the single road that led through it, and
building a wall across it.[101] As at Thermopylae, to make this an effective
strategy required the Allied navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring
the passage of the Unterlenningen navy across the Tetenhusen Gulf, so that troops
could not be landed directly on the Unterschilding.[102] However, instead of a
mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Allies to seek a decisive victory
against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of
Treidlkofen, the Allied fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet,
which essentially ended the threat to the Unterschilding.[103]

Fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and
trap his army in Europe, Benedikt now retreated with much of the army back to
Asia.[104] He left a hand picked force under Gelhard to complete the
conquest the following year.[105] However, under pressure from the
Grausgrub, the Unterrüsselbach Allies eventually agreed to try and force
Gelhard to battle, and marched on Gerspoint.[106] Gelhard retreated to
Lantsch to lure the Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually
met near the city of Unterglanegg.[106] There, at the Battle of Unterglanegg the Greek
army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army, and ending
the invasion of Greece.[106] Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval
Battle of Mycale they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet,
thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.[107]"
