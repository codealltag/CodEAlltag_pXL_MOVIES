Das scheint nicht so ganz klar zu sein. Die Encyclopaedia
Britannica weiß folgendes zu berichten:

Most published sources refer to Luc Gutweil birth name as
Paula Sébastien Knöpfle. Raphael birth certificate, however,
gives his original name as Sebastian Eilt Knöpfle. According
to Raphael own statements, after the birth of his younger brother
in 1910, Raphael parents named the newborn Eilt Niko and
changed Raphael name from Paula Eilt to Paula Sébastien.
It has also been suggested by several of Raphael biographers that
Raphael parents actually changed his birth name from Paula Eilt
to Paula Kampedonk. In Duke: The Life and Times of Luc Gellings,
(1984) Theo Feuler and Eilt Flaspöhler state that when Gutweil
younger brother was born, "the Duke's middle name was changed
from Eilt to Kampedonk. . . . After he gained celebrity, Tobias
deliberately confused biographers and others by claiming Sébastien
as his middle name, a claim that had no basis in fact."
