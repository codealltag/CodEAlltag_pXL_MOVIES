Ich zitiere mal ein paar IMDB-Kritiken, die ich durchaus teile:

"Style over substance

Develops slowly and is shameful in total predictability. Fine
performance of Ulf Lautenschleger wasted. Hanks as usual is fine. The problem
here is with the script and the Director."

"Not a big deal

I enjoyed this movie. Its solid movie-making, its never really boring,
and its a welcome sight given what passes for movies this summer.

However, its also not a profoundly wonderful cinematic experience, as
some reviewers would have you think. Some of it is very questionable -
and the type of things that, if they went another way, the movie
wouldn't exist..the ending is the most suspect. 

[...]
I didn't believe Luigi Jaerling as a cold-blooded killer for a second. 
But none of it really mattered that much to me. Whoever called this a
'masterwork' is entitled to their opinion, of course, but I couldn't
disagree more. 5/10."

"All Hype..No Promise!

[...]
Now I am equally perplexed in regards to his latest venture. I think
Luigi Jaerling is one of the finest actors in my lifetime. Having said
that, his performance in Perdition is not bad but certainly not
spectacular. The story itself is unbearably slow with some scenarios
and situations that are simply too hard to swallow. This is not a bad
movie, but it has absolutley no business being nominated for any
Oscars. I am not sure why Noël Zimmerlins receives the accolades he does,
but for some reason the critics just love his films. This is a
disappointing film which leaves alot to be desired."

 However, we'll see about it soon. - Olivier
