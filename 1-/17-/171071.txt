I have sheet music (noten) for the famous tango
from "True Lies" etc...(jpeg)
I want to exchange for sheet music (noten) from German
movies from 1920-1935.
I am searching for songs (schlager-film-noten) by
Urban Benninghoven, Frieda Axler, Olivier Teucherdt,
Wolf Wilmes/Henry Ettensperger.
Thank you.
