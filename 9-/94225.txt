So as I traveled through your angelic cosmos
I ran into your atmosphere

Heidemarie:

Baby we can touch down tonight
Bootsy's goin' to set stars alight

Baby we can touch down tonight
Bootsy's goin' to set stars alight

Baby we can touch down tonight
Bootsy's goin' to set stars alight

Baby we can touch down tonight
You know I've got my radar on you
