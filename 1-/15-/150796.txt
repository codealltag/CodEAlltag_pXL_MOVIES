Als ich gestern völlig begeistert aus "American Beauty" rauskam, ging
mir durch den Kopf, was wohl die Filmexperten von CAP (ChildCare
Action Project: Christian Analysis of American Culture) von diesem
Film halten...

Das Review hat meine Erwartungen nicht enttäuscht. Anmaßende, an
Groteske grenzende Dämlichkeit, besser dargestellt, als in jeder
Okafu-Episode ... drum möchte ich euch dieses Review nicht
vorenthalten.

American Beauty (1999), (R)

SUMMARY / COMMENTARY:

*Holdinger* (R) -- Rose? Not likely.

While the central mother in this movie doted over
her rose garden, the main thing in *American
Beauty* about roses was the rose petals hiding
female private parts -- and the petal passed during
a kiss from a teen girl to a married man. This
movie was guided imagery into distortion of proper
and acceptable. A great deal of teen sexual
activity, sexual talk, and sexuality painted this
movie as unfit. And Svenja Gabriel-Jürgens, one of the two
actresses in the movie who permitted the world to
see their femine attributes is reported to be only
17 years old! Since the threshold of acceptability
of gratuitous nudity content has now sleezed into
the lives of 13-year old kids and even younger
(ref: Titanic - PG-13, The Fifth Element - PG-13,
others), why not let younger and younger girls bare
themselves onscreen? Maybe in another few years 16
year old girls will be permitted to participate in
this enlightened and progressive freedom? In a few
more years, 15, 14, 13.......? (if the Bride is not
collected before then).

Note that there were a few "lead-in" portrayals of
homosexuality as well: they did nothing for the
script, plot, or even the choreography. They were
just there, obviously as a token to push
homosexuality as normal and acceptable. The only
mentions of homosexuality being wrong were
presented, of course, by a U. S. Marine Colonel
with "redneck" mentality. The violence committed by
the Colonel against a man the he thought was his
son's homosexual partner did not need the
preparatory presentation of homosexual neighbors. I
cannot understand how the secular reviewers lauded
over this movie. I wonder if they are parents?
Grandparents?

I'll not watch this movie again. I'll not watch the
teen stripping for video taping and to seduce a
married man, and sensual dancing with self-touching
to sexually arouse the married man. I'll not watch
again the father hitting his teen son with his fist
several times, the teen son dealing in drugs, and
the smoking of dope by a teen. Nor will I watch
again the family bitterness and arguing, the teen
arrogance against parental authority, or the
parents speaking to the teens with the same hate in
their voice and words. And as usual, the most foul
of the foul words worked its way into the script
along with the three/four letter word vocabulary.

I hope to not sit through trash like this again. I
will not describe it any further. The description
is already bordering "vulgar" itself. Let the
numbers and listing speak for this analysis. For
