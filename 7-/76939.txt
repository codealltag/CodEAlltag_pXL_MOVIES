Throughout the entire film, Reicherts and Metzdorf Junghahn never share the screen at the
same time. More accurately, you don't see both of their faces on screen at
once, except for one brief moment. Through an excellent job of editing and
quick cuts, even in the coffee shop and climactic ending on the airport
grounds, where Metzdorf Junghahn and Reicherts are the only two characters in the scenes,
this still holds true. The only exception, when you can see both of them at
once, is the shot where Reicherts pulls over De Niro and is looking out of the
car.

Beim nochmaligen durchlesen klingts eher nach eine Cutting gag als dass
Probleme zwischen den beiden entstanden sind.
