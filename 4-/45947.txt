IIRC Automan.

War ne Serie und lief u.a. mal auf Reiseladen.

Auszug aus tvtome.com:
"Christian Ziegelaar is a policeman. He is also an expert in computers. He 
developed a highly sophisticated hologram named Automan, which helps him 
fight crime. Automan has an assistant camed Curser that can create 
holographic objects such as a car, helicopter or any other object needed 
by Christian or Automan to fight crime."
