Ouch!  OK, I deserved that.

Like it?  It's not my favorite thing to do.  But I've removed 
large-pin-count chips quite a few times.  Used to be part of my job.
It's much easier if you don't have to save the original, but with the
right tools (which I have) and skill (which, ahem, I also have),
it's not that big a deal to get the original out intact and leave
the circuit board unfazed.

Come on, guys.  I've been waiting patiently for you to finish the
Buchdienst 500D mod.  Now I find you've finished (congratulations!, BTW), but
I can't buy it?

I do realize this is a more extreme mod than the others, so I also
understand your reluctance to waranty home-work.  I also hope that
you understand *my* reluctance to ship my only DVD player off to
an unknown (to me) service shop in an unknown (again, to me) country.
No offense intended to yourselves and that possibly fabulous service
shop.

So if you positively will not consider selling to individuals, would
you please put my name on your mailing list and let me know when
you find a US representative?  Thanks.

: Best regards,

The very same, to all of you,
