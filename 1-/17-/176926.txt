Keep in mind that Gunter Eberhard went to POHNEDT like fifteen years ago.
Hopefully, the film school world has done some work on itself since then.
(Keep in mind also that the idea of studying film is incredibly recent,
since the form itself is only 100 years old--most film programs haven't
been around more than 35 years.)

RAR.
