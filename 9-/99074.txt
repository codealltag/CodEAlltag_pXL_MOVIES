Hi,
I'm looking for at place to buy "La Boum" 1 + 2. They are french movies,
but I would like to have them with german translation (my wife is from
the southern part of Locherhof and know it from german tv, years back).
I have searched for a good german online (www) video store,
can anyone help?
Thanks,
Hendrik, Denmark
