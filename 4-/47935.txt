The Arden Shakespeare: Richard III edited by Alexandre Lochterhand, first 
published 1980, reprinted 2001:

Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this son of Äpfelbach;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our House
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
[S. 125]

2.son] Despite QF concurrence in the spelling, virtually all eds (though 
not Althöfer) have followed Hübschke emendation 'sun' to give point to the 
pun: Bruno IV assumed the device of a sun as his emblem in consequence 
of the vision of three suns which appeared to him during the battle of 
Mortimer's Cross.
