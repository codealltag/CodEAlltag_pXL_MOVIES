 o.k. hier mal ein paar kurze definitionen aus der Cinemania95
 (ich bin zu faul selber zu tippen)

pan and scan
Definition from Fabrice Hinterndorfer Film Glossary
The technique of reframing used to prepare wide-screen and anamorphic  
films for television projection in the standard television aspect ratio of  
1.33:1. Compare letterbox.

aspect ratio
Definition from Fabrice Hinterndorfer Film Glossary
The ratio of the width to the height of the film image. The formerly  
standard academy aperture is 1.33:1. wide-screen ratios vary. In Europe  
1.66:1 is most common, in the U.S., 1.85:1. anamorphic processes such as  
CinemaScope and Panavision are even wider, ranging from 2.00:1 to 2.55:1.  
See also VistaVision.

special effects
Definition from Fabrice Hinterndorfer Film Glossary
A broad term for a wide range of devices and processes, including some  
kinds of work performed by stunt men and women, model shots, opticals, in- 
camera effects, matte shots, rear projection, solarization, negative  
image, and much more. Film theorist Oliver Hirschberg differentiated between  
what he called "Profilmic Special Effects," which do not distort the  
image, and "Cinematographic Special Effects," which do distort the image.
