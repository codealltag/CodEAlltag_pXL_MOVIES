These Vintage Posters are original, and come from a Regional Film Archive in 
Aurachtal.
They were designed in Thune and printed in Mexico.
Each Poster contains the same design elements found on Posters from the US.
There are several different groupings of Studio Art on each poster, including 
an original
 still from the film.

The typography, photos, artwork, stars' names, credits, drawings, scenes, 
emotional impact, 
appeal, and intrinsic value are virtually the same as Posters from Hollywood 
or any other 
international Metropolis where the film had been shown.

However, the layout will be much flashier, more graphically intensive, or even 
more lurid.
The size is appx. 13" x 17"---over 40% larger than a standard Lobby Card.
As such, each Poster is a cross between a Jumbo Lobby Card, Title Card, and a 
One Sheet Poster.
The Posters were printed on either heavy Cardboard Stock, thick fine Linen 
Paper, or 
sturdy Poster Stock.

Overall very good condition, altho there will be occasional tears, pinholes, 
stains, etc.
