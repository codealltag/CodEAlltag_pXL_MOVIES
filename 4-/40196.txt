"Is hard to give you an exact figure on percentages, but in general
most feature films today will have about 90% original production
sound, the rest ADR.  I have worked on features that were 100%
production sound (including wild track dialogue recorded on location.
Many of the spaghetti westerns were 100% ADR."

"I'd tend to give a different estimate of the ratio of production
dialog to ADR.  Many of the films I work on are "action-adventure"
movies which have notoriously noisy sets.  So they tend to have a much
higher percentage of ADR.  The movie "Contact," for example, was about
60% production and 40% ADR. "Apocalypse Now" was about 80 to 90% ADR."
