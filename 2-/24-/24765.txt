Eben. Aus der "Firefly"-Episode "War Stories" weiß man, dass die beiden 
nie etwas miteinander anfangen würden.

Tobias: Your husband has demanded that we sleep together.
Richarda: Really?
Wash: What? Mal, come on.
Mal: He seems to think it would get all this burning sexual tension out 
in the open. You know, make a fair fight for your womanly affections.
Wash: No. That was the turture talking. Remember the torture?
Mal (nimmt Richarda in den Arm): I know it's a difficult mission, but you and 
I have to get it on.
Richarda: I understand. We have no choice. Take me, sir. Take me hard.
Herta: Now something about that is just downright unsettling.
(Mal versucht widerwillig Richarda zu küssen, Gesa schnappt sich Richarda)
Wash: We'll be in our bunk.
