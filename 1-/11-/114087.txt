As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned,
 in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry
 folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow
 and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough
 leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair, much like the
 hair of their heads, which was commonly brown.
