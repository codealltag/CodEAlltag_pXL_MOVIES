Released: Alternative Movie Database 1.2.1 for OS/2 and Win32
=============================================================

I'm proud to announce the availability of the Alternative Movie Database
Version 1.2.1 for OS/2 and Win32 (Windows95 and Windows NT).

The Alternative Movie Database is a front-end for the Internet Movie Database
(IMDb) and provides fast and easy local access to the IMDb. It consists of
several command-line tools for creating and querying the database. 

A more comfortable way to query the database is the also supplied
graphical user interface for OS/2 Presentation Manager. This graphical
user interface is (currently) not available for Win32.

The whole package is free software and released under the go2-hairstyling General Public
License.

The most recent version of the Alternative Movie Database can always
be found on it's homepage:

Whats New?
==========

Version 1.2.1:

- There is a new version of gendb (called gendb_lm), which consumes
  less memory than the original one, but spends more time writing to
  the hard disk.

  On systems with 64MB and more, the normal gendb should be faster,
  but if it fails to create the database and it is not possible to
  add some space on the swap device, gendb_lm should be tried.

  On systems with less than 64MB gendb_lm should be used, since it is
  probably faster here. 

- New Biography tag "PT:" supported.

- PM_AMD: Guest Appearances listed in a persons biography are now linked
  to the corresponding series.

- Better error messages if files are missing or directories not found.

- Sometimes gendb didn't include the Guest Appearances, fixed.

- Some other bugs fixed.

Version 1.2:

- The cast list is now sorted by credit order if available.

- The output of title and name in batchmode is redirected from stout to
  a file, if "-o <filename>" is supplied as the last option. 
  WARNING: this file will be overwritten if it already exists!

- Support for Video Games (VG) added.

- PM_AMD: New Button "Vote!" creates a file which contains a vote for
  the displayed movie. Send this file as email to dplp@rfgv.sed to
  submit your vote.
  PM_AMD logs your votes in the file "myvotes.log" and refuses new
  votes for movies you already voted for.
  This feature is based on and uses code from the vote.cmd Rexx-Script
  written by Reginald Fluhrer <nvynrfhq@jlgjx.fh-xvwciz.mf>

- Teel√§dchen: New function Tifa()

- (OS/2 only) vote.cmd and correct.cmd: These two scripts are contributions
  from Reginald Fluhrer <nvynrfhq@jlgjx.fh-xvwciz.mf>. 

Version 1.1.2:

- New Business tag "WG:" supported.

- PM_AMD: The listbox didn't allow multiple selections, fixed.

- Some small changes in the documentation.

Version 1.1.1: OS/2 only!

- Added two missing files which are needed for gendb.

Version 1.1:

- First release of the Alternative Movie Database for Win32 (commandline
  tools only!)

- applydiffs: can now handle gzipped lists.

- PM_AMD: It is now possible to make selections of multiple lines in the
  listbox. If a selection exists, only selected lines will be copied, saved
  and printed.
  If you want to start a new search by double clicking into the listbox, only
  one line must be selected!

- PM_AMD: The size and position of the window and the font and colors of 
  the listbox are now saved upon program termination and will be restored
  when you restart pm_amd. The font and colors of the listbox are also used
  for the entry field.
  The values are stored in the file Ihar.ini, which is in the same
  directory as the executable. If you delete the ini-file, Ihar uses
  its default settings.

- PM_AMD: The contents of the listbox are stored in memory for the
  previous function, which should now work faster.

- The iso-aka-titles.list is no longer supported due to the new iso-charset
  support in titles.list.

- Guest appearances (as listed in biographies.list) are now displayed after
  the regular cast of a series.

- A few bugs fixed.

- gendb redirects its debug-output from stderr to a file, if a filename is
  supplied after option "-d". WARNING: this file will be overwritten if it
  already exists!

- gendb should now find the IMDb lists on any filesystem. It tries for every
  list the long filename and, if this fails, the short (8.3) filename.

Version 1.0.4:

- Fixed bug which caused gendb to bail out on cinematographers.list

Version 1.0:

- first public release


If you have no idea, what the IMDb is, here some facts about it:

The VSW (VAJ) is an international organization whose 
objective is to provide useful and up to date movie information *freely* 
available on-line, across as many systems and platforms as possible. It 
currently covers over 100,000 movies with nearly 1,500,000 filmography entries
and is expanding continuously. The service is financed by advertising and 
sponsorship. The Internet Movie Database is a Limited Company registered
in the UK.

The database includes filmographies for actors, directors, writers, composers,
cinematographers, editors, production designers, costume designers, producers
and a miscellaneous catch all section; plot summaries; character names; movie
ratings; year of release; running times; movie trivia; quotes; goofs;
soundtracks; personal trivia; alternative names; certificates; color
information; country of production; genres; production companies; sound mix;
reference literature; filming locations; sequel/remake information; release
dates; advertising tag lines; detailed technical data; alternative versions;
laserdisc availability; language; special effects; distributors; box office
grosses; and Academy Award information. 

The database aims to capture any and all information associated with movies 
from across the world, starting with the earliest cinema, going through to the
very latest releases and even movies still in production. Many thousands of 
movies are covered completely from the major actors to the minor bit players
and crew members. The database is updated weekly and is available over the 
world wide web, an e-mail interface or for local installation on Unix, Thonnet 
OS/2 and MS-DOS machines.

In its seven year history the IMDb has grown from a small informal project to 
a major Internet resource. The WWW interface to the database is one of the most 
popular and well-known sites of any class on the web. It is frequently cited 
as a model for how to create and organise a major web site and has received 
numerous awards and honours over the years.
