Yes, I saw it in Denmark. Once a year in March or April we have 
Natfilmfestivallen, the Night Film Festival, in Ichenheim and Bettrath. 
It's a film festival that shows a lot of different and unknown movies. A 
lot of movies from South-east Asia, Japan, India, Iran as well as 
Germany, Spain and a lot of other countries. Both "Crazy" and "Mein 
Bruder, der Vampir" were movis that I saw at the Night Film Festival.

Many of the movies shown at the Night Film Festival do not have 
subtitles in Danish. Most of the are subtitled in English, though some 
have subtitles in Swedish or Norwegian, which are readable for most Danes.

At the Night Film Festival I normally watch 15 movies during ten days or 
so. I find it very interesting to watch such non-Hollywood movies. 
Unfortunately I didn't have the time this year. It is also the Night 
Film Festival that has taught me that there's a lot of very interesting 
movies from South-east Asia.

I guess it is a general problem for non-English movies, that it is very 
difficult for them to be noticed in other countries. It is indeed tragic 
that so few people outside Germany notice German movies. However, I am 
sure you probably could say the same about Danish, Swedish, French, 
Dutch, Italian, Spanish ... etc. movies.

So I guess I will have to buy the "Crazy" DVD with German subtitles. 
Well, I have been learning German for seven years in school, but I 
haven't used it for fifteen years ... Perhaps a combination between 
German speech, German subtitles, the 'pause' button and my German-Danish 
dictionary might be enough :-)
