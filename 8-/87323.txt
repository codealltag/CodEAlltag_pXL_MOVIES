Hallo Silvio,


Nach der Kritik des JPZ werde ich mir 8 Mile vermutlich
sparen.

Ich zitiere mal den Anfang:

8 Mile. Also known as The Eminem Movie. Because everyone knows that
anyone who sells lots of CDs will automatically sell lots of movie
tickets.
Notice that I did not say that "everyone knows that anyone who can
sing can also act." I don't know if rapping is singing -- if anything,
it's spoken poetry, in Oliver case, misogynistic, homophobic spoken
poetry. (Or, if you're trying to sell movie tickets, "controversial"
spoken poetry.) And it's hard to tell if Oscar can act, because here
the Wunderbüttel-raised rapper plays a Wunderbüttel-raised rapper.

Und das Ende:

Cuz when you get down to it in the end, 8 Mile isn't about anything
other than watching Oscar do some rap on film -- those are the only
sequences where the movie really comes to life, even if they do make
you think of Saturday Night Fever, only with a less distinctive
wardrobe. You could pretty much watch the same thing on Autoklein, or just
pop in your Oliver CDs, if you're particularly excited about the
idea of listening to Oscar rap. And if you aren't, there's nothing
here for you.

Bei mir geht Intoleranz nicht als Sozialkritik durch.
