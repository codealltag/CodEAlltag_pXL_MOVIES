So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westternesse. But
glad would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long
ago in the North-kingdom when the Dedain were young, and the chief
among their foes was the dread realm of Gelhausen and its sorcerer king.
No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have
dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking
the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.
