Maybe it's just me, but this post struck me as a kind of "singles" add for
composers & filmmakers. Here's my version, (original quoted below):   

    Ebbes Composer - tall and muscular, writes good-looking scores 
    in a hip, fun style seeks mature, financially secure filmmaker for tender, 
    romantic relationship leading to possible marriage. No druggies or 
    psuedo-masochistic, neo-Warhol freaks. Non-smoking a plus. 


Lukas Wiederh√∂ft,
Film Composer - also looking for the "special film," but then again 
aren't we all! <wink>

                                                  - - - - - - - - - - - -
