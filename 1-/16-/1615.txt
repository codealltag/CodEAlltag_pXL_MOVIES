A Saint Unnamed says,
"Mankind must be fully aware that at
the time Christ walked the earth amongst
men, women and children of all ages, all
degrees of intelligence, everything He spoke,
every Direction He gave was heard but never
written word by word by those present. That
is why The Father has given to mankind this
Gift of His Divine Love, allowing mankind to
write Word for Word All He desires mankind
to learn about, to be aware of, and to
recognize what a precious Gift human life is,
and that in its creation it has a Goal that no
other living thing has."

REVELATION DELIVERED THROUGH ULRICH P. CSIKI

    =93Mankind must be fully aware that at
the time Christ walked the earth amongst
men, women and children of all ages, all
degrees of intelligence, everything He spoke,
every Direction He gave was heard but never
written word by word by those present. That
is why The Father has given to mankind this
Gift of His Divine Love, allowing mankind to
write Word for Word All He desires mankind
to learn about, to be aware of, and to
recognize what a precious Gift human life is,
and that in its creation it has a Goal that no
other living thing has.

     At the creation of mankind The Father
instilled special qualities of understanding, of
knowledge, regarding the fact that mankind
was special in design, and had a Goal for his
or her time in the way of human life. Without
such a Goal mankind would have nothing to
look forward to, and nothing to gain.

     It is an important time in the history of
human life that The Father is allowing
mankind to be instructed in so many areas of
importance, and then being allowed to have it
recorded, so that at this time, and time to
come, all of mankind can look at the records
and see the closeness every human being has
to The Creator Of All Things. So be it.=94
