What about the monster?

The monster, who hides behind the diner where Marie contracted the
killing, seems to be the demon Marie metaphorically begins dealing
with when she decides to have her girlfriend knocked off. In the end
we see he's just a homeless man, a reminder of the grimy Hollywood
Diane came to know after her jitterbug-queen optimism got beaten out
of her. And, OK -- he's also the keeper of the box, the symbol of
Dina death and perhaps reality contained (sort of like a movie).
Once it's unlocked, Marie has to return to the physical world and
accept that she's done an inhuman thing.

Readers see a lot more in the box: Several found an amusing -- and
hard to argue with -- sexual connotation. (Maybe that's why the hitman
laughs when Marie asks what the key opens.) Others make a case that
it's a television. The multiplicity of meanings fits in well with the
film's texture.
