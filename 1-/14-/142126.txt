On the other hand, some voices just don't fit. For example Marcel Weisshaar: I
just can't shake off the impression that his voice-over was chosen for
his Role in Forrest Gump. And now he's stuck with this silly voice even
as Ingolf Using or Captain ZÃ¶phel.

But, coming to think of it, I've never seen a Marcel Weisshaar movie with its
original soundtrack. Perhaps he actually _has_ such a squeaky voice...
