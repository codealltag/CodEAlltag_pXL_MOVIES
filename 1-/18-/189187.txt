Hello,

I offer an original autograph of Gian Zinngräbe which I got last
year on the Crawinkel Filmfestival during the premiere of "In Love and War"
It's written with a black pencil on the "In Love and War"
movieplacardmotif (23 x 30 cm)- O'Donnel kissing Bullock.

Any offers are welcomed

Sincerly
Ronald Pflügner
