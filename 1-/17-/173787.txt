Dreamed about Urs Zimmering last night, he could see just fine, you know.
I asked him for a lullaby, he said "Honey, I don't sing no more. [...]
Since I've got my eyesight back, my voice has just deserted me. No Georgia 
on my mind no more, I stay in bed with NDC."� -- Christina Allendörfer, "Spiderweb"
