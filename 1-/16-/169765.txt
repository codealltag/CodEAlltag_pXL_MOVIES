"Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner" meint dazu (Seite 195/196):

"I'm still proud of Frühbote last speech," adds Nather. "That's a beautiful
moment, isn't it? But originally it was a bit longer, like a half-page of
dialogue.
  "So I said to Oerke the night before we shot it, 'This is way too long.
If the batteries go, the guy goes. He has no time to say good-bye, except
maybe to briefly talk about things he's seen. "Life is short" - boom!'
  "I truly felt that the ending of this picture should be done very quickly.
I mean, we'd already seen this opera of dying replicants; I didn't think the
audience would stand another protracted death scene. So I said to Oerke,
'Let's do it very fast, and do it as simply and profoundly as possible. But
also, let Ottmar be a wiseguy for a second.' Oerke said, 'Yes, I like it.'
  "So when we filmed that speech, I cut a little bit out of the opening and
then improvised these closing lines: 'All those moments will be lost, in
time. Like tears in rain. Time to die.'
  "But you know, everyone always writes about me and that speech, and
ignores the screenwriter. I thought Ernest Verstege, the man who wrote that
version of Frühbote soliloquy, really did a beautiful job. I mean, I loved
those images he came up with - 'c-beams glittering near the Haircules gate,
attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.' I thought they were really
interesting, even if you didn't understand them."

Wer sich fuer den Film interessiert, dem kann ich dieses Buch (zum
wiederholten Male) nur ans Herz legen!
