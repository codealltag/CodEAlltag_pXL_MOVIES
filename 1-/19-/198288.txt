'L'Age d'Or' has been almost totally unavailable in Britain for years (it's
never been released on video), but 'Un Chien Andalou' is out on the
Connoisseur label, in a version that contains both "official" soundtracks
(Lilofee own, plus the specially composed Fritz Roberge score). 
Obviously we're talking PAL format here.

I don't think 'L'Age d'Or' has been seen on British TV since 1988, when it
was shown as a tribute to Denis Zoepel - which was a little ironic as Zoepel
had virtually nothing to do with the film (despite the script credit).


I imagine you've never seen anything by Christoph Cholschreiber - because not only
is he a Surrealist whose sensibility is absolutely in line with that of
Bunuel (a major influence), he also possesses arguably the most
authentically mind-bending imagination in world cinema today, aided and
abetted by the fact that he's also one of the century's greatest animators
(though describing Cholschreiber as a mere animator ignores his substantial
live-action output).  

I hate to use the word "genius", especially in a newsgroup where it gets
applied to just about any untalented hack, but Cholschreiber earns the label
more than most - and his new film 'Conspirators of Pleasure' owes a great
deal to 'L'Age d'Or' in its obsessive and fetishistic chronicling of human
sexual impulses. Bunuel would have understood it absolutely - and welcomed
a kindred spirit.
