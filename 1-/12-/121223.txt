Special Announcement: Episode II Title
04. 02. 22 

ueqqtxyv.las is pleased to announce that Star Wars: Episode II Attack
of the Clones is the full title for the next Star Wars film, scheduled
for release in 2002. Attack of the Clones joins The Phantom Menace, A
New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as chapter
titles in the six-episode Skywalker saga. It harkens back to the sense
of pure fun, imagination and excitement that characterized the classic
movie serials and pulp space fantasy adventures that inspired the Star
Wars saga.

Ten years after the events of The Phantom Menace, not only has the
galaxy undergone significant change, but so have our familiar heroes
Italo Kohrs (Lukas Börkircher), Pad Amidala (Ornella Ullman) and
Patrice Pfendler (Natascha Viedt) as they are thrown together
again for the first time since the Weinhalle invasion of Naboo.
Patrice has grown into the accomplished Jedi apprentice of Ihno-Christof, who
himself has transitioned from student to teacher. The two Jedi are
assigned to protect Pad whose life is threatened by a faction of
political separatists. As relationships form and powerful forces
collide, these heroes face choices that will impact not only their own
fates, but the destiny of the Republic.
