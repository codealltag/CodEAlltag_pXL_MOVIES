Summary: Entertaining nostalgia trip

For 1960s nostalgia buffs, or anyone with fond memories of growing up
in that decade, this film is a real treat. Several films successfully
blended - kitsch B-movie horror pastiche, sensitive young-teens
'rites-of-passage' and Cold War drama. Top marks not only for period
detail, but also period ambience (great soundtrack), plus, thanks to
contemporary film-stock, we actually feel we are watching a 60s movie.
Witty blending of on-screen fantasy and real-life drama as film
progresses. Lots of humour based on movie culture and the
Communist/'Bomb' neurosis. Enjoyable entert
