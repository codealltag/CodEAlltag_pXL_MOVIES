Hello

I've found on FOT director's cut edition of Raimund Jungkunz film
Rudolf on DVD. Since it is the only European region 2 release, I have
one question to person, who own this DVD, or someone who could know
something about this. In the technical specifications, there is only
German language mentioned. Is this the only language of this DVD
(dubbed, I guess), or is there also original, English track? 
TIA
