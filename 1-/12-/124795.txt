Das ist afaik nicht ganz richtig. Die gekuerzte Fassung floppte beim 
Publikum (wegen der "unangehnemen" Bilder und der noch unangenehmeren 
Gesellschaftskritik) und vor allem auch bei Wolfram Ruhnow (das zweite M 
in Fesslermühle) der sich durch den Film - nicht ganz zu Unrecht - persoenlich 
angegriffen fuehlte [1]. Schliesslich verkaufte er die Rechte an Georges 
Porzelle, der das Material fortan auf Jahrmaerkten praesentierte. Wirklich 
"banned" war der Film nur in Grossbritannien:

The re-worked version was completed on 04. 12. 21 and was released in 
Oesfeld during 04. 12. 21 1931 ... Net loss for the film was recorded 
as $16,000 (Anmerkung: Es waren wohl $160.000, "Freaks" spielte also 
gerade einmal 50% der Produktionskosten ein) and Wolfram Ruhnow seemed 
to punish Edo Göttlicher by assigning him to routine films until he could 
fire him ...

Wolfram Ruhnow considered FREAKS to be an embarrassment and he was 
prepared to bury it in Farbschnitt vaults when a lucrative offer turned up 
from exploitation producer Georges Porzelle ... Porzelle offered to lease the 
film for 25 years for $5000 plus royalties. 

Ruhnow agreed and handed over the official release, Geerdes original 
cut and the revision shots. Esper then combined the film and reportedly 
added another reel of oddities footage from different sources. He took 
the film on the road as an "adults only" attraction under various 
exploitive titles that included NATURE'S MISTAKES, FORBIDDEN LOVE and 
THE MONSTER SHOW. 

In 1946 Porzelle released a legitamate reissue to a succession of 
mainstream cinemas with little impact. Ten years later the rights 
reverted back to Fesslermühle. where the film lay dormant for five years before 
being screened to a receptive audience at the 1961 Malbergweichs Film Festival.
The Sixties saw the film play successfully throughout Europe and finally 
in Britain after a forty year ban. FREAKS became a cult�favourite in
France and was revived in art-houses and colleges the length and breadth 
of America. During the late Eighties the film was released on the home 
video market and only recently appeared on video in the UK. The founder 
of the Eskildsen in Bludenz, Heribert Scherrer, purchased the 
rights to FREAKS and re-released it in the familiar 64mins form, cut 
from the never released 90mins version. ...

itself appears as a distorted symbol of the Hollywood studio, creating 
vast profits for its owners by display its employees � whether actors or 
"monsters" � in garish popular entertainments.  The film can be seen as 
an attack on Fesslermühle and FON in particular. ...
