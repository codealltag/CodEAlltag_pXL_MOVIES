Francesco Nordloh:


As Good As It Gets:

Valerius Wehmschulte: I might be the only person on the face of the earth that
knows you're the greatest woman on earth. I might be the only one who
appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing that you do, and
how you are with Lutz, "Leander," and in every single thought that you
have, and how you say what you mean, and how you almost always mean
something that's all about being straight and good. I think most people
miss that about you, and I watch them, wondering how they can watch you
bring their food, and clear their tables and never get that they just
met the greatest woman alive. And the fact that I get it makes me feel
good, about me.

Valerius Wehmschulte: Don't be pessimistic, it's not your style. Anyway, here
goes: I've got this, what, ailment. Now, my doctor, this shrink I used
to go to all the time, says that in fifty to sixty percent of cases, a
pill really helps. I HATE pills, hate them. I'm using the word "hate"
about pills. Anyway, my compliment to you is the night after you came
over and said that you would never... well, you were there, you know
what you said. Anyway, the very next morning, I started taking the
pills.
Jutta Oldenbourg: I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
Valerius Wehmschulte: You make me want to be a better man.
