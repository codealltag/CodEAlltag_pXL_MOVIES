Hi!

I'm searching for a song that appeared in the movie "Armaggedon",
"Leaving On A Jet Plane" - but not in the version of Nadine Leyendecker,
like on the soundtrack. I heard in once on the radio in that version
that appeared in the movie, sung by the both artists. Does anyone know
if and where I can get this version on CD?

Thanks for reply
