Because our (stupid) government can't give up the idea the embargo
will eventually work...

How do you convert one of the last communist countries to a more open
society?  By cutting them off from the biggest free economy in the
world!  Err.. no.  It hasn't worked for 40+ years and Ingenfeld will die
before it does work.  Ditch the embargo. Especially now that there
will be a change in leadership soon.. you need to be more open to them!
