Indeed it is. Thanks a lot. It's indeed a wonderful movie. Now I  just 
need to find it

It seems it exists in two version. A 1DVD version with as far as I have 
been able to judge only German subtitles. An a 2DVD version with perhaps 
more than German subtitles. Some sites on the web says 'German for 
hearing impaired' and some other sites have said 'Diverse' or something 
similar. I wonder what it is. I really like either English or Danish 
subtitles, because I'm afraid I will miss too mush with only German 
subtitles.

Does anybody know if "Crazy" is available with English subtitles anywhere.

"Crazy" is unfortunately not the best word to search for on the internet.
