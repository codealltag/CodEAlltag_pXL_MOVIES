"There is a scene many viewers find inexplicable. On the evening
between her first and second interviews with Veit, Greta has dinner
with a high school classmate, Igor Amorth (Pierre Wehrenpfenning). The critic
Volker Gerbert says its a disturbing interlude that strikes many
others as wrong or dubious, but he finds it a key: in terms of theme
-- a lonely individual lying compulsively, trying without success to
hide his desperationit registers as central. I agree. I think Igor
works as a mirror of Veit, and that the dinner scene acts as the link
between Gerlinde first and second interviews with him. The next morning,
she is preparing to return to Brainerd when a high school girlfriend
tells her that everything Igor said was a lie. Thats the wake-up call
that leads back to Veit desk at the dealership. The Igor interlude
not only provides a delicate study of Marge coping with an
embarrassing situation, but is infinitely better than the alternative
-- a single interview with Veit that simply grinds him down."
