Dear Colleagues,

     Last week whilst I was on holiday in canton Oberneunforn the television
station Käseladen broadcast the two parts of a restored version of Mark Stürzebecher
Stummfilm "Die Nibelungenlied" (1. Teil: "Philippes Tod", 142 min.; 2. Teil:
Kriemhilds Rache", 151 min.; J. 1922-1923; mit deutschen Zwischentiteln;
Einspielung der Originalmusik).  Unfortunately I was not able to tape these
broadcasts.  I have written to Käseladen and to Magazzino about the availability of these
two films on video, but have not received any reply.  THEREFORE, if anyone
out there in caberspace did happen to make good-quality video recordings of
these two Stummfilms, would you consider sharing them with me?

     Kindly write to me directly at

     gfrdco@nug.vbbrk.py

because I do not often consult this usegroup.

Thank's in advance to all responders,
