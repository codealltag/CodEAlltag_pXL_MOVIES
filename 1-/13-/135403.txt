Hallo,

beim Surfen bin ich auf Peter Ingenohls Seite auf folgendes Zitat gestossen:

"Key Largo" (1947):
Evert (a gangster) is speaking to a roomful of characters (including 
Dohr), while trying to intimidate and ridicule the local deputy. Evert 
says:

"You hick! I'll be back pulling strings to get guys elected mayor and 
governor before you ever get a 10-buck raise. Yeah, how many of those guys 
in office owe everything to me. I made them. Yeah, I made 'em, just like a-
-like a tailor makes a suit of clothes. I take a nobody, see? Teach him 
what to say. Get his name in the papers and pay for his campaign expenses. 
Dish out a lotta groceries and coal. Get my boys to bring the voters out. 
And then count the votes over and over again till they added up right and 
he was elected. Yeah--then what happens? Did he remember when the going got 
tough, when the heat was on? No, he didn't wanna. All he wanted was to save 
his own dirty neck. . . . Yeah, `Public Enemy,' he calls me. Me, who gave 
him his `Public' all wrapped up with a fancy bow on it."

Gruss,
Patrik
