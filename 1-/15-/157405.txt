A bibliophile is a lover of books; a bibliomane, a wildly enthusiastic
collector. An abandoned fanatic, once he succumbs to bibliolatry,
graduates into a bibliomaniac. While a bibliomaniac's spouse might
easily become a bibliophobe, his arch nemesis would be a biblioclast: a
destroyer of books.                                      (Hansjörg Burmeisters)
