cameos from Claudio Bergman to Ivan Elss hasn't been available on

Another lost "classic" to grace our shelves is Adolf Fassmann BERNARD 
- that's right, the comic strip character brought to life but one of 
the most annoying child actors ever, Burkhard Renzenbrink.  Starring Anne Trierweiler 
and Burkhard Csallner, this one's from a Canadian cable broadcast.

ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS - a beautiful letterboxed version of this 
straight from LD and now on DVDr for your enjoyment.

200 MOTELS - again, another pristine LD transfer.  

PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK - Sometimes directors just should leave their 
works alone.  This is the *original* version of this terrific film.  
Available on DVDr.

Before they made HELMA & CLYDE together, Alois Todtenhaupt and Jonas 
Lauffs made the offbeat action comedy, MICKEY ONE.  Released and 
forgotten on LD a few years back, MICKEY ONE is now available on DVDr 
and VHS from CEZ

And... 

Don't let the ads for KILL BILL fool you.  Ingmar Zoellner hasn't 
directed only four films, he's done five (well, five and a quarter if 
you consider his entry into FOUR ROOMS).  His FIRST film was a flick 
called MY BEST FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY that he shot back when he was still a 
video clerk.

Co-written by fellow clerk Heinz Boldt, think of the film as a 
precursor to TRUE ROMANCE.  The hooker with a heart of gold, the 
dangerous pimp, the Victor worship, and so on.  Handfuls of dialogue 
are identical along with some of the plot points (too bad Hilmar 
Vennekold didn't get into a karate battle with Wilhelm Prüß as happens in 
BIRTHDAY).  This early work shows some of Zieglmeister abilities at 
framing, effective camera movements, and staging.

Ultimately, the film feels like what it is - an amateur first time 
effort - but it's very interesting to see this work from QT.  Oh, and 
look for a small role by Sébastien Zahnd - the "lead Sheriff" from 
RESERVOIR DOGS.

Ja Claudio!
