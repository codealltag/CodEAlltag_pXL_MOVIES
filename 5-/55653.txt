     This movie starts off slow, the main woman in the film is
violently attacked in the elevator by a man with scissors, I think it
was actually rape. She is taken in by twin brothers after the
incident, the handicapped brother is very moody, while the older
brother is helpful. Well, she gets an invitation to go to a strange
apartment some place. When she was in, she find no one in the
apartment, but when she tries to get out, the door knob falls out.
Little things start going on, and every time she falls asleep, things
happen, like doors open and stuff. Probably the best scene is when she
finds her attacker from the elevator in the bed room with a scissor in
his back, with a bird flying around, saying that she killed him. At
the end, we find that she was placed in this apartment by her
"trusted" psychologist, in an attempt to drive her mad. When the
psychologist and his wife, or is it associate, enters the apartment,
she has enough smarts to walk out and trap them in there. She walks
outside and is picked up by the nice twin brother that she ran into
earlier in the movie.

        The ending is satisfying, the pace is a little too slow, but
it's generally a good movie in my opinion.
