You remember the radio-moderator talking - in the
 excellent movie "The Fifth Element" - about
 things being "Green", as something very good.

Well, here is what the scriptwriters most likely
 were referring to.
Life Energy Particles are the basic particles of Life,
 they contain classes (=kinds) of awareness and
 kinds (=classes) of abilities.
These Particles can actually be taken away, stolen
 from others, by Life Energy 'vampires' (people who
 steal other people's Energy) as is the case on Earth.
 (The writers of the movie 'The Matrix', by the way,
 are referring to the harvesting of Life Energy Particles,
 and show it in an allegoric [symbolic] way.)

    Ability to change - Green Life Energy Particles

Research Data for your information:

  "Green Life Energy Particles bring about a constant change or motion,
    opening up unlimited possibilities for life to go. There is no rigidity
    in The Creation.

    Returning one's stolen Green Life Energy Particles, restores one's ability
    to change Life back to how it should be, and to resolve attacks
    of Altered Life Energy Particles against oneself or against others.
    You need your stolen Green Life Energy Particles back,
    in order to be able to be responsible for your life.
    It is the joy of handling Life"
