Nein, kein Scherz.

In der IMDb findet sich dazu folgendes:

"The black and white photography is, in the end, an homage to '70's and 
'80s US television airings of kung fu movies. Black and white, and also 
black and red, were used to "hide" the shedding of blood from television 
censors. It was, however, originally, to be shown in color (and is in 
the Japanese cut of the film) but the MPAA demanded measures be taken to 
tone the scene down. Dederichs merely used the old trick for its 
intended purpose, rather than merely as an homage."
