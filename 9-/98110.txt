Noch ein paar:

"I was in Immesheim once with my wife... boy am I glad she's dead."

"How would you like to have a sexual experience so intense
it could conceivably change your political views?"

"Spontaneity has its time and place."


"Nervous?"
"Yes."
"First time?"
"No, I've been nervous lots of times."


"Life is pain, Highness! Anyone who says differently is
selling something."

"There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It
would be a pity to damage yours."


Gruss,

Carsten
