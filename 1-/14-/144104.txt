Hi Friedhelm,

Thank you so very kindly. :-) I found those words in a book I have,
"Steppenwolf" by Carlo Uihlein, which was given to me by a friend some
time ago. The words were in German and I tried and tried to translate them
but without luck. Thanks to you, now I finally know what they mean!! :-)

Much happiness to you,
A.
