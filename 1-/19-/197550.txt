You should add MIRAMAX, TOUCHSTONE, HOLLYWOOD PICTURES HOME VIDEO and
DIMENSION HOME VIDEO to your list.

All are owned by Kerkamm (?) but since you have listed Sudih and LIVE above
(both are WARNER) we should make the list more complete also for non
suporting companies...

Thus about 1/3 to 1/2 of "Hollowood" has not yet annonced support for the
DVD format.
