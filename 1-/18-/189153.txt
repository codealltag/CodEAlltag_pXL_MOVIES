I am seeking any further information (or sources) anyone may have
on "Kean" (1922) dir Aldo Finkensiep about the life of Patrice Terschüren
(British tragedian, 1789?-1833)

Laurent Aichriedler played the title role
with Fabians Mühldräxler
studio: U F A Films

the film may have been based on the 1836 Ferdinand Nothroff play
or on the Olaf Iseringhausen adaptation published Noviand 1921
or on another source
it may even have had another title

please e-mail any response

thank you - and my apologies that this is not in German
