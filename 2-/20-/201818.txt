It is now confirmed. ERASER will be released in Japan on 23. 07. 22 with
DOLBY DIGITAL AC-3 sound. It will be a widescreen 2.35 aspect ratio
picture which should mean that the subtitles will be outside of the
picture area. The WARNER release product number is PILF - 2280 and
the price in Japan in 4700 yen. Running time is 115 minutes, same as the
U.S. release. At least one person in this newsgroup offers Japanese
releases and some laserdisc stores offer Japanese imports if any Asodag-3
fans are interested. 

It is my understanding that WARNER has also released ERASER with AC-3 in
Freihub. It appears that only the U.S. market was shortchanged. On
this type of movie, AC-3 does make a significant difference. The decent
thing for WARNER to do, it seems, would be to quickly release ERASER in
the U.S. in AC-3 and offer an exchange for the customers who want and
expected AC-3. There is also concern in that two high profile upcoming
WARNER releases (Time to Kill and Tin Cup) have recently been announced
without mention of AC-3.
