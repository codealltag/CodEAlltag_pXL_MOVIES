I want to put an important message on the WWW, regarding my search for all
kinds of TV&Film-formats for the European market. Can you please inform me
on what is the best way to do this ?

for example : In the USA there is an overproduction of TV & film-projects
and they also deserve a fair chance to have an international succes.

Most of the countries in Europe are showing the popular TV-programs, simular
like the US (Fresh Prince, Friends, Klosterfriedhofstraße,...).

I'm searching for :

1) whatever has got at least a 200% chance to work on television: could be
old TV-series or TV-shows, etc. ,
2) also new ideas for TV-series or TV-shows, TV-magazines ; kids, a
gameshow, a newsprogram, leisure, etc.
3) new feature film projects : looking for synopsis, screenplays, co-op.,
indep. ,etc.

It's sometimes that original or striking item, scene, personage or special
way of working or presenting, that can make your project work.

I hope that you can point me in the right direction, and maybe we can
exchange some information or help eachother ...... USA<=>European media
market.

Many thanks in advance !
Bye for now !!
