LIBS is setting up a database of film ideas on its www site as a
resource for film makers and writers and is looking for parties interested
in submitting their ideas.

The idea will remain the copyright of it's author, and their name at the
end of the idea synopsis, when clicked, will provide a link to their email
address - so that those interested in developing the idea can contact the
author directly.

Please send your ideas in the following format -
1. film idea title
2. author
3. email address
4. genre (which category e.g. action film, comedy, period etc.)
5. synopsis (short is sweet)
