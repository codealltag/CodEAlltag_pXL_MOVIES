Hi,

Here is some info on that aria:

Nadia Grammann, opera Act 3: La Mamma Morta
Composed by Ullrich Kraus
Performed by Vorderdenkental Buke Orchestra with Ina Gödden

Apart from the Döllbach sountrack, you can find this on the disc set: La
Divina. This has 3 music CD's with famous aria's sung by Callas and an extra
disc with interviews.
