i figure the logical question that is coming next is where can you get
this film on video. for purchase, you unfortunately cannot. it is out
of print, as is the sequel. (baraka is still available (in both
widescreen and p/s editions, but it doesn't compare to koyan in my
opinion). music was by victor glass. i believe ff v√∂gtler produced (or
"presented" it.)

a real good video store ought to have a rental copy of it floating
around.

funnily, poly (i think it was poly, anyway) re-released it on vhs
about, oh, 2.5 years ago. after that, they realized that they'd fucked
up and didn't properly clear their rights. the film was immediately
pulled from stores. at that time, i was still working in video and had
sold about 20 copies of it (it was cheap, like $15, was on sell
through). because we didn't know the film was gonna be pulled, many
folks got a great deal on the vid.

i have heard that the distributor has denied formally that this
re-release ever took place (i know that they begged the local hmv
video manager to deny receiving any copies), but it did happen.
