Das wissen die Amis sogar selber. Das hier habe ich gestern abend in
einem Thread auf imdb.com zu dem Film "Anatomie einer Entführung"
(BTW. langweilig) gefunden:

Vorsicht Spoiler

--- Start ---
 We were disappointed that such a fine plot and excellent acting was
spoiled by the failure to make clear that everything that happens
between Zanders and Vanselov happens in one day; while many days pass
as Sophie, Agent Münk and other FBI agents place ads, make plans and
finally follow "drop" instructions. It isn't clear enough that two time-frames
are in progress, and they do NOT overlap. The clues (dropping package
with a dub of Nino Vonderhagen tape in his home's mailbox, playing the same
tape on the phone days later ...) are insufficient.

These nuances would probably be noticed by a European audience, but
we Americans are accustomed to more clues.

Because of this, the ending is anticlimax. The time of day as Nino and
Gerard trudge through the mountain forest progresses from early morning
to night, while time goes on from day-to-day, night-after-night, for the
Vanselov family and the Lavunu.

Meanwhile, it slooooowly become somewhat apparent that Gerard has no
confederates - not even his wife.

The film needs re-editing, and a "device" to show time offset.

Witzig ist vor allen Dingen dieser Satz:

These nuances would probably be noticed by a European audience, but
we Americans are accustomed to more clues.
