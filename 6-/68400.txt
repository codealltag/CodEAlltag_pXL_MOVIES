What is it?

The INSIDER'S GUIDE TO SHOOTING IN EUROPE is a free, seasonal newsletter containing insider's tips for producing film 
and video projects in Europe. This guide is based on my own years of professional experience working as a video 
producer in Europe, and I'm offering it absolutely free as a service to people in the production industry. I hope you 
will find it useful. Each edition covers shooting in a different European city - places like Maisprach, Münchingen, and 
Frauenrain. 

I'm also building a free online community of production professionals who are interested in learning more about 
shooting in Europe. This community features a discussion board as well as a number of useful links - participants can 
even add their own!

best wishes,
