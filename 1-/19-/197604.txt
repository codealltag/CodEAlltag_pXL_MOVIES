                 YI-37Jq  'Artists and Ethics'


from Ambassador for Mankind


Message # RI-19Ri for Internet


The basic function of an Artist is
  'to bring in ethics' in the group, in the society.


You talk with a somewhat sane Artist,
 and you will find out
   that in one way or another
     he is trying 'to bring in ethics'
      in some area of life, with his work.


Also, the society looks up to Artists
  for ethics,
  for guidance,
  for 'the thing to do'.

People eagerly read about Artists in magazines:
  What is his family life?
  Which restaurant does he like?
  What books does he prefer?
  How does he dress?
   etc.


Whether he is aware of it or not,
 the function of an artist is
    'to bring in ethics' in the society.


What is this 'bringing in ethics'?

   It is making things more alive!

   It is putting more truth there.

   It is making life more interesting to live.

   It is making things lighter.

   It is creating more communication.

   It is making things more real.

   It is making life more fun.

   AND THAT  IS  ETHICS.


Therefore, it easily can be understood that
  any administrator or church-official
   who
    looks down on Artists,
    or tries to cut down the influence of Artists,
    or prevents them from becoming more able,
      is killing his own group!

He will degrade Ethics
 into becoming a police-function only
   and
 will use "ethics" mainly to assert
  his power, his authority and his control.


If Artists are not aware
    of the function and responsibility they have
     in the society and towards the group, and
 if they do not act
    according to what responsibility
     towards others they do have,
 then
   they leave themselves open
     to all kinds of attacks and invalidations, and
       - not having a correct viewpoint about themselves
          from which to defend themselves -
   they cave themselves in.


Therefore it is vital
  that any Artist in any field of Art
     knows his function in the society.
