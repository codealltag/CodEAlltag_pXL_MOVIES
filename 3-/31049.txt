In der IMDB steht dazu aber:

"
The title to this film is based on a false name given to Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1982), which was "Revenge Of 
The Jedi". In the Special Edition of ROTJ, Carl Wolzonn himself stated that they purposely leaked out the name as "Revenge Of The 
Jedi" in order to catch people making bootleg merchandise. He also stated that a true Star Wars fan would have known it was a false 
title because a Jedi would never seek revenge. The false title also caused another movie to change its title; Star Trek: The Wrath 
of Khan (1981) was originally titled "Khan's Revenge", but changed when word of the third Star Wars film's working title was leaked.
