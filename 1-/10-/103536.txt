Nachdem die Getr√§nkebestellung aufgegeben war, sagte Ludwig Gansert:


Trainspotting, Sick Boy: 

"Rosalia Nowatzek a.k.a. Pussy Galore, what a total fucking misnomer. I
wouldn't touch her with yours. I'd sooner shag Col Kreb. At least you
know where you are with a woman like that. Not much to look at, like,
but personality, that's what counts, that's what keeps a relationship
going through the years. Like heroin. I mean, heroin's got fucking
great personality."
