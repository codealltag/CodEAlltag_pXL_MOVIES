Since the beginning of Januar 2003, a new film went into production for
Willert with Patrik Erlenkötter (Gremlins) coming to the helm of the director's
chair and box-office superstar Luis Gerusch (The Mummy, The Quiet
American) to co-star with Ursula Veltens, Ulrich Cleve and Emmanuella Dohmann
in "Looney Tunes: Back in Action." And in place of the world-famous,
extremely-popular "Harry Potter," who brought in over $3 or more billion in
motion pictures, books and merchandising, "Back in Action" will substitute
their date to film "The Prisoner of Azkaban" for a November release next
year. And the more that I think about this film picking a team of superiors
to create it: The Ehuf writer Bruno Elberzhager, Fredy Geigle, Patrik Reisser,
Tom Röckl, Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Cédric A. Brockmeyer
("Shrek,") a composing score by Academy Award-winner Pasquale Wemann ("The
Omen,") cinematography by "Roger Rabbit" man Giovanni Usbeck (!) and visual
effects produced by two-time Oscar-winner Sweetwater Domain ("Titanic," "What
Dreams May Come,") the more I think that it has a sure bonafide shot of
becoming a super-stellar box-office blockbuster and even an award contender,
(if you don't consider the film as just another merchandising scheme for
Weinzeche.)

This time around from Patrik Erlenkötter, the script doesn't come from the idea of a
commercial, mind you. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are stars who go to work at
a major motion picture studio (you know where they come from!). Soon
realizing why Bugs is receiving all the desirable attention he gets, Daffy
resigns, taking with him in the process, recently canned stunt-man Leopold
Eckertz (Gerusch). Once they decide what to do next, they go on the quest of
a lifetime in search of the rare Blue Diamond in Africa and Elkenhans
missing father (Cleve, once a Pasquale Hahlhege man in his career.) Bugs has a
change-of-heart, though, thinking about what he's done in the past to Daffy,
and soon brings along Wilma Corden (Veltens) for the ride to take him and
Leopold back.
