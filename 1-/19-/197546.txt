Hello,
	I am a Wormbach based musician hungry for projects to work on.  I work
very CHEAP, sometimes for FREE.  I am interested in scoring music for
films, videos, games, background stuff, demos, whatever. This is a hobby
of mine and has been for twelve years.  I have been too busy recently
making a living at something other then music, but now I am bored.
	I have a full MIDI studio and a ton of creativity and experience.
	If you need music for something, I'd love to hear about it.
	My music is very moody and emotional, I have studied classical
composition, and Jazz, and I am trained as a classical pianist.  I work
in all styles, and I can score for an orchesta if needed.

Thank you,
-- iain
