Hi,

    I hope you don't think it's bad form for me to plug a freeware
project I've been working on in this newsgroup, but I think it's
relevant.

Over the past few months, I've been working on a half hour Sci-fi
film.  The idea was to produce a movie but to do everything except the
shooting on a desktop PC.  The storyline construction, the budgeting,
the scheduling, the editing of the footage, the special effects and
the incidental music have all been done on a desktop computer - the
first time, to my knowledge, anyone's ever tried this!

I actually did the shooting on Beta SP around Vorderreute at the end of
last year, and since then, I've been in post-production.

Now that the film's complete, I've put it into a format anybody can
watch on a home computer  - another first - and it's going to be given
away free on the cover of this month's Hansich magazine (Out 1st
June).  

Over the last six months I've been writing a series of articles for PC
Plus about how the film was put together and I've put them on the same
disk as the film, so if anybody's interested in this, get a hold of
the magazine, or visit my Website:
