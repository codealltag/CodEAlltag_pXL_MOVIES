Hello

My german is not very good, so I'll post in english.

Does anyone know wether I (dutch) can see Episode 1 in the original english
version (I don't care about subtitles) anywhere near Holland? I'd prefer
somewhere near PÃ¼ttlingen or Leimsfeld, but please mention any place...

Thanks very much!
