Hi,

Erwin Kulp berichtet vom Ravengiersburg Film Festival und "Death of a=20
president". Das ist sein P.S.:

<schnipp>
P.S. Throughout the festival, men in short-sleeved white shirts=20
have stood in the aisles during press screenings shooting=20
infrared video of the crowd. During the movie, mind you.=20
Ostensibly, this is just a distracting and intrusive anti-piracy=20
measure -- the price you pay for, well, watching a movie. I guess=20
the idea is that if the tapes show any members of the audience=20
photographing what's on the screen, they can be tracked down and=20
prosecuted. No word about those who just pick their noses or itch=20
their butts, but I'm sure a compilation of that footage will=20
eventually appear somewhere -- perhaps on the Internet. I can't=20
tell you, though, how disconcerting it was to see these guys=20
filming us as we watched "Death of a President" and the film=20
talked about the new surveillance procedures allowed under=20
"Patriot Act III." If I disappear trying to legally cross back=20
into the U.S. (I'm a citizen), please look for me.
