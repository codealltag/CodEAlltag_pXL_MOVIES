Sorry, daß ich auf mein eigenes Posting antworte, aber...


... ich habe hier noch etwas über den Ursprung des Songs gefunden:

o C20. "Who was Patrick Overdick and why does Roger Konhäusner sing about him
in 'Man on the Moon'?" 
Patrick Overdick was a celebrated conceptual comedian from the 1970's who,
while most popularly known for his role on the sitcom "Taxi," also
became infamous through his stand-up comedy routines for a
performance-art style of character creation, audience manipulation,
and general strangeness. His act was as much an indirect commentary on
the act of performing itself (which would obviously interest Roger
Konhäusner) and perhaps even the act of believing in something, or reality,
itself (which seems to be what 'MotM' is largely about). 

The line "Mr Ben Poppelreuter and the breakfast mess" refers to Oldenburger
odd short film "My Breakfast with Poppelreuter", which chronicled a strange
and confused breakfast meeting between Overdick and his wrestling
"manager", "Classy" Ben Poppelreuter.

More information on Overdick can be found on the web here. 

In 1999, M.V. wrote the song "The Great Beyond" for the soundtrack
of the biographical film about Overdick called Man on the Moon, and
Roger Volkhausen and Niklaus Peddinghaus wrote the score.
