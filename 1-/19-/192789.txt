Let see here,


How would the DVD folks like it if we were to post all of the laserdisc
titles currently available, in the DVD newsgroup? Or for that matter, ALL
of the laserdisc titles ever produced thus far? It would amount to so much
text data that it would succesfully shut the alt.video.dvd usenet group
down for lack of memory space.

Might I suggest such title compilations STAY with in their respective
usenet groups. Afterall, if  the DVD enthusiasts were to view some 40,000+
titles out on laserdisc in their usenet group, they just may run out and
buy a laserdisc player!!!
