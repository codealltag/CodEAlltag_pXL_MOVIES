Hi Charles,

if you actually want to learn German, it might be worthwhile to consider 
some dubbed version of an English film you already know. 
Thus, if you're not able to understand certain parts of the dialoge, you'll 
get a hint of what the people are talking about by listening to the 
original version.

Regards

Niels
