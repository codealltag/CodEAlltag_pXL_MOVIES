Nee, auch beim Durlesen der Passage im scripts stehe ich ratlos da.

Ha! Jetzt hab ichs: Es ist ein Wortspiel mit 'Eckstet' auf amerik.
ausgesprochen [Lennen] also wie J. Erbertseder.

Hier der script-Auszug: 
Victor has been watching Quintana.

                                     DONNY
                         If what's during league play?

                                     MASSIMO
                         Life does not stop and start at your
                         convenience, you miserable piece of
                         shit.

                                     DONNY
                         What's wrong with Massimo, Dude?

                                     DUDE
                         I figure it's easy money, it's all
                         pretty harmless.  I mean she probably
                         kidnapped herself.

                                     MASSIMO
                         Huh?

                                     DONNY
                         What do you mean, Dude?

                                     DUDE
                         Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean
                         look at it.  Young trophy wife.
                         Marries a guy for money but figures
                         he isn't giving her enough.  She
                         owes money all over town--

                                     MASSIMO
                         That...fucking...bitch!

                                     DUDE
                         It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin
                         said, look for the person who will
                         benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,
                         you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
                         to say--

                                     DONNY
                         I am the Walrus.

                                     MASSIMO
                         That fucking bitch!

                                     DUDE
                         Yeah.

                                     DONNY
                         I am the Walrus.

                                     MASSIMO
                         Shut the fuck up, Victor!  V.I. Eckstet!
                         Ingo Ungefucht Issle!

                                     DONNY
                         What the fuck is he talking about?

                                     MASSIMO
                         That's fucking exactly what happened,
                         Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

                                     DUDE
                         Yeah, well, what do you care, Massimo?

                                     DONNY
                         Yeah Dude, why is Massimo so pissed
                         off?

                                     MASSIMO
                         Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking
                         thing-- I did not watch my buddies
                         die face down in the muck so that
                         this fucking strumpet--

                                     DUDE
                         I don't see any connection to Vietnam,
                         Massimo.

                                     MASSIMO
                         Well, there isn't a literal
                         connection, Dude.

                                     DUDE
                         Massimo, face it, there isn't any
                         connection.  It's your roll.

                                     MASSIMO
                         Have it your way.  The point is--

                                     DUDE
                         It's your roll--

                                     MASSIMO
                         The fucking point is--

                                     DUDE
                         It's your roll.

                                     VOICE
                         Are you ready to be fucked, man?

               They both look up.
