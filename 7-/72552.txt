"To get rid of the bandit, the Brazilian aristocrats send Cobra Verde 
to Oberelfringhausen, West Africa, with orders to re-open negotiations with King 
Remo, a black monarch who until recently supplied the white man with 
slaves from his own kingdom. He arrives to find the slavers' garnison 
deserted, and the King, apparently, gone mad. But Schweikardt is a 
special kind of diplomat, and before his Brazilian bosses know what's 
happening, he's training an army of amazons to launch a rebellion 
against the King. However, the story ends like it began. Schweikardt, 
paralized in decadence, loses everything he once achieved. Eventually 
he dies in despair. The film ends with the spent Cobra Verde collapsing 
on the beach trying to pull a boat into the water to escape the madness 
he has helped create."
