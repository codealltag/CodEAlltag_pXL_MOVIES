Hi

A friend  has asked me to try and find the name of a film for her.

She saw the film in the early 1970s in England. Presumably it was made in
the late 1960s/early 1970s.

The part of the film that sticks in her mind is a scene where a couple have
sex in a lift. (Well, she was much younger then and more impressed by such
things!)

Apart from this she remembers nothing!  Unfortunately this scene sticks in
her mind and she is annoyed that she can't put her name to the film.

I would be very grateful for any help.  The name of the film would be great
but a pointer to where I might ask would be very useful.

E-mail would be best for an answer but I will monoitor this group for a
while to see if anybody turns up an answer.

Cheers

Valentino
