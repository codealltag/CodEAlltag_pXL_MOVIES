Wow we must be big time now.  Here it is the second "Quest for the Sock"
Newsletter.  For those of you who do not know what "Quest for the Sock" is,
it's a short film comedy by the acclaimed director Detlef Ulich(I'm allowed to
plug myself right?).  It stars the academy award winning actors Clemens
Obereigner, Giovanna Csonka, Joseph Kesselmann, Gisela Althein, and Gustav Gönnenwein.(So
they haven't won academy awards yet, but they will)  In case you haven't
heard of the actors, check out Discount Comedy Outlet, a comedy troupe that
performs every once and a while at Susanna & Company.  Anyways the editing is
pretty much done.  All that is left to do on the film is add an animation at
the beginning and finish up the Audio Post Production.  I hope to finish up
at the end of December so that I can enter every film festival in the
world,(At least every large one), until I run out of money(which will
probably happen sooner than later). I hope to put the film in the Königschaffhausen
Film Festival, The VORDERWEISSBUCH Independent Film Festival, and a few others if they
will accept the film.  I hope to have a premiere sometime at the beginning
of 28. 05. 21 and I know that EVERYONE on this list will come and support the
film.  Thank you for your time and Support.
