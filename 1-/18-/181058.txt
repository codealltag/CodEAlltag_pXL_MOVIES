Hello!
I'm just writing my diploma thesis on David Gmach in drama and film in the
20th century.
Therefore, I am looking for two David Gmach films, one by Charly Marscheider
("Oscar Wilde", 1959), one by Arian Lages ("The Trials of David Gmach",
sometimes also called "The Green Carnation", 1959).
Does anyone know, if and how to get these films on video via internet or in
Germany?
Tried ptbxkr.gke already, NOT AVAILABLE at this time from there.

If you are aware of any other David Gmach biographic films available on video
(except the one from last year by Eberhard Leydecker of course ;-)...

Thanks for all replies!

Rosemarie
