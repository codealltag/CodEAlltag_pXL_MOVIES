I have a signed album page signed in 19. 03. 22 while Meinhard was making
Giant.  It is signed in black ink (not ball point) on a bluish green album
page.  Also signed on the same page is GSDV Onno and Liane Cat. 
It is in excellent shape and Maximilian signature can be matted away from the
others or left as is-either way it looks great.  Price is $3,300.00
postpaid insured in the U.S..  I will have a jpeg I can send shortly, so
e-mail if interested.
