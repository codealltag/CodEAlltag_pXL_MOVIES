"I am NOT the Messiah!"

"Crucifixion?"
"Yes."
"Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each."

"Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers. Chaffinch brains. Jaguars' earlobes. 
Wolf nipple chips. Get 'em while they're hot. They're lovely. Dromedary 
pretzels, only half a denar. Pecheigen fried bats."

"I want to be a woman. From now on, I want you all to call me 'Marga'."

"Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!"

"Sit down. Have a scone."


Samuel
