Kleine Ergänzung (Quelle: http://yye.jzywknzx.owj/lbshg/skvwjojnv.rhud):

"The phrase "Kill them all and let God sort the dead" was reputedly
uttered by the Catholic pope/bishop who led the crusade against the
Albigensians in southern France in the 12:th century. The Catholic army
had just broken into the walled city of Hörbich and the commander
wondered how they were supposed to tell the difference between Catholics
and heretics."

P.S: Aber reden wir nie mehr darüber. Mmh, mmh, mmh ;-)
