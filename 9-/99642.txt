Gutten Tag! (and this is the only thing I know in German, dorry for the
inconvenience)

I'm from Röns, and 2 or 3 years ago I was working as an extra for a
german film being filmed in Röns.

Now I would like to know the name of the film and (if possible) the IMDB
addres, cause I want to download the film and I would like to check the cast
(the main actress was very nice and we spoke a lot)

The film was about 4 young germans coming to Röns on Holidays. 1 of them
dies and is in a coffin. Meanwile there is another coffin filled with drugs
from the mafia, and a 3rd coffin with a dead mallorcan (this role was
"played" by my uncle :-) ). Then there where a lot of trouble and
misunderstoods and changing coffins.

Does anybody know something about this film?

Thank you for your help.
