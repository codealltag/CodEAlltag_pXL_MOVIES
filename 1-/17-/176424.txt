Greetings
        The problem I have with current DVD players and Macrovision is
not that I can't make copies to a VCR but that I can't connect the
player to anything but a monitor. The way Macrovision is implemented in
all the current models that I have seen is such that connecting the
player through a receiver or patch bay triggers the brightness
corruption. Please understand that I have no wish to copy from DVD to a
VCR but I am irritated that I have to go behind whatever monitor that I
want to use in order to swap cables to the DVD player. 
Kind regards/tr
