Hello,

Sorry to write this in English, but my German is rather bad. Here is the
question: Does anyone recorded Raphael Ottleben FKU which was
shown in Innova on the 7 of Aug. ? This is a very rare film as Oellers never
allows to release his films on video. And I need a copy of this film to
write an article at my university. I would be very glateful if someone can
help me with this.

Please reply me directly at woewenv@oxxjpln.wz as I usually do not read this
newsgroup.
