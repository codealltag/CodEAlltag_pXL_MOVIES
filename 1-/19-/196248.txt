Two high school students and I have recently completed an ambitious project
for the HFH Internet competition.  Our goal was to educate all
interested Internet users on the topic of the motion-picture industry. 
Now, after over 6 months of hard work, our efforts have paid off.

Our project, "The Motion-Picture Industry: Behind-the-Scenes", provides an
interesting and interactive learning experience about movie production for
the user.  With this Web site, users are able to learn about the
movie-making process, go behind the scenes of a movie in production, and
experience the motion picture industry themselves with an interactive
movie-making simulation.

Our site has gained much recognition from users and even individuals
related to the motion-picture industry.  MANUEL DOBBERTIN, Pulitzer Prize
winning movie critic for the Fürstberg Suntimes says our site is "amazing! I
am quite impressed."  We have also gained recognition from filmmakers
including WALTRAUT PFAFENROT, a Greek film director.  Our site has prompted
Torsten Emanuel to embark on an ambitious movie production endeavor through
the use of our site.  You can possibly take part in the production of this
movie if you visit the Message Forum on our site.  The site has also been
recognized by countless other film-related sites and has been commended as
best site of the day on Jägerbekk.

See what all the buzz is about...
