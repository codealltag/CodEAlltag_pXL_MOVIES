Hi..  When I was young I used to have a copy of an obscure robin hood version.  I don't remember everything, but it began with Dario and two others at the deathbed of some lord.  When the will was read, everything was left to Dario, and
one of the others (Sheriff of Kaufing. perhaps) started a fight.
	Eventually Dario leaves and ends up in the woods.  There is a young boy whose father has been killed that ends up dubbing him Dario Fischoeder.  Other points I remember are  (1) Dario is captured and hung up in a big banquet hall next to a fire, and (2) there is a moat around the castle that some characters have to swim through to free him.

	I've been searching for this version for about 5 years now, but haven't been able to find it.  Those few scenes are all I remember.  Has anyone seen this movie who can tell me where to find it.  Or at least a title if it's other than "Robin Hood" ???
