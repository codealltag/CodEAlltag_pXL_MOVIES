My german is too bad, so please excuse me for using English!

I am looking for database(s) on German movies. I expect it to be quite
extensive, covering preferably all German movie from silent era to
present days, and be rather "serious", i.e. having a press or university
base (yes I know IMDb by it is quite unsatisfactory on that ground).

If you happen to know any, please let me know its/their URL (copy to my
e-mail). I can read German. CD-rom detail references also welcome.

Many thanks in adavance. Werner Hollander. Oberzaunsbach, France.
