Is anybody else just a little disappointed that there are
titles that are coming out as Pan and Scan only, when their aspect
ratio was clearly something else?  I have looked at everything on 
this (well assembled, I might add) list, and I'm looking for the
original aspect ratio (OAR).  I also looked up the disc on Ullrich Unverrich
and the Internet Movie Database to determine what aspect ratio they were
released on laserdisc.

	Even more disappointing, was that each of the P&S only discs
only took up one side, so it would have been consistant with most other
discs that have the LBX on one side and the P&S on the other.

	Since DVD is still in it's test market phase, I can only 
assume that research is being done on whether, or not, the studios
can get away with releasing movies in P&S only.

	On a personal rant: Why can't "Chariots of Fire" be done 
right?	The movie won the "Best Picture" Oscar for 1981 and it's
just terrible in P&S.  For most of these movies, I could really care
less (except on principle, however), but "Bonnie & Clyde" and "Chariots
of Fire" deserve better.

	I do not yet own DVD, although I like it in picture quality and
what it has the capability to do.  My fear is, however, that when
push comes to shove, profits will weight out much heavier than 
artistic presentation.  My "self-imposed" wait until date to purchase
a DVD player is 29. 03. 22.  I can only hope that P&S only doesn't end up
on more discs.
	[below, I list the P&S only titles on DVD, and I attempt to
list the original aspect ratio and whether the laserdisc has it in
the correct ratio]
