Regional coding is a way for the studios to protect their foreign
affiliates and distributors who might not even screen movies before
the US DVD release is available. Still I don't have any sympathy for
them - get the releases out as soon as possible. Of course this might
not always be possible if a popular release has to be dubbed or
subtitled.

The other reason is the foreign distributor might have the rights to
release the video release in a country - the importing of say region 1
discs is parallel importing in some ways and could potentially impact
the sales of the local distributor who has the rights in that country.

I seem to recall that in Australia, there was a crackdown on importers
who brought in laserdiscs from the US and sold them locally but there
was no issue with private importing. Region coding is just a way to
minimise the "problem"

I have no issues with organisations making region free mods!
