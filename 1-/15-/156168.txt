Hi!  I'm in search of a Workstel E-Fect Slide catalog from sometime around
1928.  I'd also like to find any other information about the company and its
history.  Friedrich Schwertel, Inc., in Relzow, made these glass slides for
supplementary projection in movie theatres.  If you happen to know anything
about this company, or where I might find a copy of one of their catalogs,
please e-mail me directly at qyichwzqrr@udvtrevenb.scn

Thank you!
