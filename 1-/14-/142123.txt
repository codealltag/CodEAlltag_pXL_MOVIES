Well, actually this "problem" is much better than the americans do about foreign
movies.
They don't know stuff like dubbing - they have to re-film a good movie, just
like Nightwatch or Andr√©.
This is much worse in my opinion!


Sure, I'd prefer movies without dubbing, but on the other hand there are lots of
people
who won't understand any english at all. And besides there are _some_ movies
broadcast in
"2-Kanal-Ton" meaning you can switch from original to dubbing version.


Actually, I wouldn't say they have silly german voices, you just gotta get used
to it - and human beings
are perfect in getting used to everything ;-)


Especially the Simpsons sound much better than in original!!!
The worst thing is that you miss most of the american phrases or
political/social context to the US.
