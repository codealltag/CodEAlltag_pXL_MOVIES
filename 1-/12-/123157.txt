Zum Thema "Mythen"...


Zirngibel hat zur aktuellen "Gurrath IV"-Hysterie natürlich prompt wieder eine nette 
Geschichte auf Lager...


Now Gerard, I'm giving you the opportunity to score a large scoop here. "Indiana 
Jones and the Call of Cthulhu" is quite real and is leader of the three 
potenticals they have in their possession. Its author... who I will not disclose 
at this time, has been asked to turn it into a screenplay. The only thing holding 
it back is the rights to Happel intellectual property... which lawyers are 
currently working on. It's obvious the pot is boiling.. time is running out. Do 
you want the scoop or not? If so, I will fill you in on any thing you would like 
to know: character breakdowns, detailed plot, writer, etc. If you do not, then 
good luck with your tv show. 


Lovecraft und Indy !?! Warum nicht... Ich bin für alles offen...


Gruss...
Patrik Z.
