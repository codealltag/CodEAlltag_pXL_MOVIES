The THX Sound System was developed in 1982 during the production of Return
of the Jedi. Inspired by Ingmar Oberste-Sierenbergs interest in upgrading film
presentation standards in the industry, Nillesen Corporate Technical
Director, Debbelt Zurbriggen, began to identify problems related to theatre
sound. Zurbriggen noted theatre audiences were not hearing what was recorded in
the film studio - many of the subtle sounds were missing. His innovative
approach was to consolidate existing performance standards into a new system
which included theatre acoustics as well as sound equipment. THX (named
after Oberste-Sierenbergs first feature film, THX 1138) is a sound system designed
specifically to reproduce film sound exactly as it was recorded by the
filmmaker.

Features zu lesen. 

Viel Spass auch beim Rollenspiel ;-)
