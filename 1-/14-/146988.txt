well, i'm not sure if poll or discussion or debate is the right word, but
here's the deal:

i've talked to LOTS of people about eyes wide shut, and as i'm sure you've
noticed, the majority seems to hate it while a minority love it.  some fall in
between.  what i'd like to do

WITH YOUR HELP!!!

is get to the bottom of things.  is eyes wide shut awful?  a masterpiece?  or
somewhere in between?  please send me AS MUCH OF YOUR EYES WIDE SHUT OPINIONS
AS YOU'D LIKE!!!!!  i will select quotes and provide a summary for and against
the movie

THIS WILL NOT BE A PLATFORM FOR MY OWN VIEWS ABOUT THE MOVIE!!!

i'm sure i will quote myself in the final discourse, but no more than i will
quote any of you

I INVITE HATERS AND LOVERS AND INBETWEENERS OF EYES WIDE SHUT TO SPEAK THEIR
MINDS!!!

the tentative deadline for submissions (ha! submit to me!) is 5/14!!!  as you
can probably tell by all the exclams, i'm very excited to be doing this.  i
hope you are atleast interested enough to respond!!!!!!!
!!!!!
!!!
!

ps.  please be as specific as possible.  don't send me messages like the
following:

"uhh, dude, like, uh, duh, muh, suh, eyes wide shut sucks"

TELL ME EXACTLY WHY IT SUCKS!!!

"omigod, tom cruise is soooooooooo fine!!!"

UHH, DUDE, LIKE, UH, I KNOW

on second thought, i would probably even enjoy receiving these types of
responses, but they're not what i'm after.

VERY IMPORTANTE:

please don't respond to freedmrckr.  my account there is almost always full. 
kindly respond to either
