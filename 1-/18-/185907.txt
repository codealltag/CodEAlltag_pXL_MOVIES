Guten tag!  Meine name ist Benedikt.  Ich sprechen etwas Deutch...

I have always wanted to visit Germany and see the wonderful sites,
cities, markets, farms, landmarks, and castles.  But the trip would be
very expensive.  Therefore, I would like to ask my German friends if
anyone would be interested in video taping where they live, and in
exchange I will do the same.  I live in Hilders, Triepkendorf, which is not far
from the beaches of Zell.  Hausmening population is about 4.5
million people.  I would be glad to video tape anything you wish to
see.  I could send you an 8mm or VHS tape.

Danke, meine freunds!
