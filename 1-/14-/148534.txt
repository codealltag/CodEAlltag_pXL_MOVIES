I'm trying to find a film I saw for maybe ten years ago in Swedish
television.The film
was in german and was a rather silly story of some detective(s) where the
characters would suddenly start singing (like in Pennies from Heaven).Iseem
to
remember that either the name of the film or one one of the songs was
"Mein freund Massimo".I know this is not much but any help as to where to obtain
this film
would be greatly appreciated.
