 of your time. It will be worth it, I assure you. For only 5 dollars,
 how can you go wrong?
 THIS REALLY DOES WORK!!!!
 It only cost me the postage and $5.
 READ ON.

 *** This is a true story ***

 hello! I've got some awesome news that I think you need to take
 two minutes to read if you have ever thought "How could I make
 some serious cash in a hurry???" , or been in serious debt,  ready
 to do almost anything to get the money needed to pay off those
 bill collectors. So grab a snack, a warm cup of coffee, or a glass
 of your favorite beverage, get comfortable and listen to this
 interesting, exciting find!
    Let me start by saying that I FINALLY FOUND IT! That's right!
 I found it! And I HATE GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES!! I hate those
 schemes like multi-level marketing, mail-order schemes, envelope
 stuffing scams, 900 number scams... the list goes on forever. I
 have tried every darn get rich quick scheme out there over the
 past 12 years. I somehow got on mailing lists for people looking
 to make money (more like 'desperate stupid people who will try
 anything for money!').  Well,  when I was a teenager,  these
 claims to 'get me rich quick' sounded irresistible! I would shell
 out $14.95 here, $29.95 there, $24.95 here, and another $49.95
 there.  I had maxed out my new Circuit City Card AND my Hurrlein...I
 was desperate for money!!  So, I gave them all a chance but
 failed at every one of them! Maybe they worked for some people,
 but not for me.  Eventually, I just tossed that JUNK MAIL in the
 trash when I got the mail.  I recognized it right away.  I can
 smell a money scam from a mile away these days,  SO I THOUGHT....
 I thought I could sniff out a scam easily.  WAS I WRONG!!
 ......I LOVE THE INTERNET!!!

    I was scanning thru a NEWSGROUP and saw an article stating to
 GET CASH FAST!!  I thought..."Here on the Internet??  Well, I'll
 just have to see what schemes could possibly be on the internet."
 The article described a way to MAIL A ONE DOLLAR BILL TO ONLY
 FIVE PEOPLE AND MAKE $50, 0000 IN CASH WITHIN 4 WEEKS!  Well,
 the more I thought about it, the more I became very curious. Why?
 Because of the way it worked AND BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY COST ME
 FIVE DOLLARS (AND FIVE STAMPS), THAT'S ALL I EVER PAY....EVER!!

    Ok, so the $50,000 in cash was maybe an tough amount to reach,
 but it was possible.  I knew that I could at least get a return
 of $1,000 or so.  So I did it!! As per the instructions in the
 article, I mailed out ('snail mail'for you e-mail fanatics) a
 single dollar bill to each of the five people on the list that
 was contained in the article.  I included a small note, with the
 dollar, that stated "Please Add Me To Your List."  I then removed
 the first position name of the five names listed and moved
 everyone up one position, and I put my name in position five of
 the list.  This is how the money starts rolling in!  I then took
 this revised article now with my name on the list and REPOSTED IT
 ON AS MANY NEWSGROUPS AND LOCAL BULLETIN BOARD
 MESSAGE AREAS THAT I KNEW.  I then waited to watch the money
 come in...prepared to maybe receive about $1000 to $1500 in cash or
 so....
 But what a welcome surprise when those envelopes kept coming in!!!
 knew what they were as soon as I saw the return addresses
 from people all over the world-Most from the U.S.,
 but some from Canada, even some from Australia!
 How much did I get in total return?  $1000? $5000? Not even!!! I
 received a total of $23,343!!!  I couldn't believe it!!
   I now have a brand new black OAC to speak for, due
 to this!! Now after almost 8 months, I am ready to do it again!!!
 so maybe it was possible to get $50,000 in cash, I don't know,
 but  IT COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON YOU, THE INDIVIDUAL!  You
 must follow through and repost this article everywhere you can think
 of!  The more postings you achieve will determine how much cash
 will arrive in your very own mailbox!!  It's just too easy to
 mass up!!!
    Let's review the reasons why you should do this:  The only
 cost factors are for the five stamps, the 5 envelopes and the 5
 one dollar bills that you send out to the listed names by snail
 mail (US Postal Service Mail).  Then just simply repost the
 article (WITH YOUR NAME ADDED) to all the newsgroups and local
 BBS's you can.  Then sit back and, (ironically), enjoy walking
 (you can run if you like! :o  ) down your driveway to your
 mailbox and scoop up your rewards!!  We all have five dollars to
 put into such an easy effortless investment with SPECTACULAR
 REALISTIC RETURNS OF $15,000 to $25,000 in about 3-5 weeks!  So
 HOLD OFF ON THOSE LOTTERY NUMBERS FOR TODAY,EAT AT
 HOME TONIGHT INSTEAD OF TAKEOUT FROM McDONALDS AND
 INVEST FIVE  DOLLARS IN THIS AMAZING MONEY MAKING SYSTEM
 NOW!!! YOU CAN'T LOSE!!

 *** End of True Story ***

    So how do you do it exactly, you ask?  I have carefully
 provided the most detailed, yet straightforward instructions on
 how to easily get this underway and get your cash on its way.
 SO, ARE YOU READY TO MAKE SOME CASH!!!?? HERE WE GO!!!

 *** THE LIST OF NAMES IS AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE. ***

 OK,  Read this carefully.  Get a printout of this information,
 if you like, so you can easily refer to it as often as needed.

 INSTRUCTIONS:

 1.  Take a sheet of paper and write on it the following:
 "Please add my name to your list".  This creates a service out
 of this money making system and thus making it completely legal.
 You are not just randomly sending a dollar to someone, you are
 paying one dollar for a legitimate service.  Make sure  you
 include your name and address.  I assure you that,  again,  this
 is completely legal!  For a neat little twist, also write what
 slot their name was in: "You were in slot 3",  Just to add a
 little fun!  This is all about having fun and making money at
 the same time!

 2.  Now fold this sheet of paper around a dollar bill or some bills
in
 another currency worth the same amount or more (no checks, money
orders
 or coins), and put them into an envelope and send it on its way to
the
 five people listed.  The folding of the paper around the bill will
 insure
 its arrival to its recipient. THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT!!

 3.  Now listen carefully, here's where you get YOUR MONEY COMING
 TO YOUR MAILBOX.   Look at the list of five people;  remove the
 first name from position one and move everyone on the list up
 slot one on the list.  Position 2 name will now move to the
 position 1 slot ,  position 3 will now become position 2, 4 will
 be be 3, 5 wil be 4.  Now put your name, address, zipcode AND
 COUNTRY in position 5, the bottom position on the list.

 4.  Now upload this updated file to as many newsgroups and local
 bulletin boards' message areas & file section as possible.  Give
 a catchy description of the file so it gets noticed!!  Such as:
 "NEED FAST CASH?, HERE IT IS!" or "NEED CASH TO PAY OFF
 YOUR DEBTS??",  etc.  And the more uploads, the more money you
 will make, and of course, the more money the others on the list will
 make too.  LET'S ALL TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BY BEING
 HONEST AND BY PUTTING FORTH 120 PERCENT INTO THIS
  PROFITABLE & AMAZING SYSTEM!!! You'll reap the benefits, believe
 me!!! Set a goal for the number of total uploads you'll post, such
as
 15-20 postings or more!  Always have a goal in mind!!! If you can UE
 encode the file when uploading,  that will make it easier for the
 people to receive it and have it downloaded to their hard drive.
that
 way they get a copy of the article right on their computer without
 hassles of viewing and then saving the article from the File menu.
 Don't alter the file type, leave it as an MS-DOS Text file. The
 best test is to be able to view this file using CutClub
 Notepad for Windows 3.x or WordPad for Windows '95. If the margins
