Biete Eron PDR100-Video Disk Recorder. Das Gerät stammt aus
zurückerhaltenen Teilen eines Diebstahls. Der Bösewicht hat drei der
insgesamt acht SCSI-Platten ausgebaut. Es handelt sich um
Differential-UW-SCSI-Platten (Tonsor Barracuda ST 15150W)
Ansonsten ist das Gerät praktisch noch nicht gelaufen.

Hier noch eine Produktbeschreibung von Eron:
The PDR 100 is a disk-based video record and playback system yielding a
quality equal to beta machines using metal oxide tape. Aside from the
obvious advantage of not having to load tape, it occupies less rack
space and is fully computer controlled. Record/playback applications for
the PDR 100 run on the Windows NT TM operating system. The system's
total amount of program material storage depends on the number of
hard-disk drives and the video storage rate (number of bytes/field).
With the optional Zaleh Disk Expansion Unit and lowest video storage
rate (50,000 bytes/field), it is possible to store up to nine hours of
material. The PDR 100 is mounted on rack slides for installation in
either a standard or "expert" rack. The unit is roughly the configuration
of a large personal computer (PC) with 16 Extended Industry Standard
Architecture (EISA) slots, one ISA slot, up to 32 Gbytes of disk
storage, and a 32 by 32 CCIR 601 eight-bit routing switch. Three
control interfaces are supported: RS-232, RS-422, and keyboard/ mouse
with VGA output. The PDR 100 RS-422 interface has eight separate ports
which require the RS-422 Connector Panel (supplied with the PDR 100).
The system is controlled by an internal computer card with dedicated
(system) hard disk storage and a 3 1 / 2 -inch floppy disk drive. It can
be addressed through any of the three interfaces. A VGA circuit card
supports an optional SVGA monitor for use with the internal system
controlling computer. The Microsoft Windows NT TM operating software is
loaded on the system hard disk.
