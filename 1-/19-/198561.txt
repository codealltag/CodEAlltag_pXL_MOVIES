screenwriting industry, which includes:
FILMMAKER, FILM CREW, FILM COMMENT, FILM THREAT, HOLLYWOOD SCRIPTWRITER,
THE INDEPENDENT (Film & Video Monthly), MOVIEMAKER, SIGHT AND SOUND (the
UK) and others from around the globe!

As well, we constantly research relevant newsgroups, mailing lists, and
web sites on the Internet and  World Wide Web to provide our subscribers
with up-to-date *news and information* on the independent scene!

Our goal at AutoVeri is to become the 'USA TODAY/READER DIGEST' of the
