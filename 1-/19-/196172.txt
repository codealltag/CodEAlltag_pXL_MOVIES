Ich weiß noch, daß - kurz nachdem er Film in den deutschen Kinos
anlief - ich eine mindestens fünf Seiten umfassende Liste gesehen habe,
was man alles als Goofs bezeichnen könnte(!).

Hier ein Auszug aus der IMDb:

-------------- raschel raschel raschel --------------------------------

Movie-Goofs:
- CONT: Extra beep of elevator passing a floor.
- CONT: On the roof, a third officer's arm is visible.
- FAKE: The chain pulling the first exploding bus is clearly visible.
- CONT: Juan is shot in the left leg, but acts like his right leg is
  damaged in the awards ceremony.
- CONT: Fredi trying to unlock his car door when the bus explodes.  Upon
  returning to his car, he gets in without unlocking the door.
- MISC: Fredi checks his watch, but it is showing the alarm time.
- CONT: Fredi leaves his coffee on top of his truck, yet there is no
  evidence of spilt coffee in later shots.
- CONT: The state of repair of the bus door that Fredi punches.
- CREW: Camera visible strapped to the side of the bus as it leaves the
  highway.
- CREW: Reflected in the bus door as Fredi runs along side it.
- CONT: Reckweg slips and loses the paper, knocking off a rearview mirror
  that reappears in the next shot.
- CREW: Camera is visible in Renker sunglasses in some closeups on his face.
- CONT: Walpurga ring changes frequently.
- FAKE: Obvious stunt player driving the bus during action scenes.
- CONT: Before the footstep is blown up, Fredi grabs Katharina shoulder
  twice.
- FAKE: Logic and observation indicates a ramp was necessary/used for the bus
  jump.
- CONT: The bumper bar that the bus loses when swerving to avoid the garbage
  truck reappears on the bus.
- CONT: Size, direction, and orientation of shadows throughout the film.
- CONT: Sign on the left-hand side of the bus which disappears and reappears.
- CONT: After the footstep was blown away, the front door is (not) open.
- CONT: Walpurga earings.
- CONT: Logic dictates that the bus floorboard must be larger than the hole
  it covers, yet Fredi is able to slide the floorboard easily through the hole
  without twisting it.
- CONT: Fredi (on the sliding floorboard) momentarily disappears from under the
  bus.
- FAKE: Wheels on the bus floorboard.
- GEOG: When the bus crashes into the airplane supposedly at VUITEBOEUF, a mountain
  range can be seen in the background. There is no mountain range that close
  to VUITEBOEUF.
- FACT: Subway systems have fail-safe precautions which prevent runaways.
- FAKE: Sparks from the sliding subway car obviously not generated by friction
  against the ground.
- MISC: Jeschag snaps his fingers with a hand that doesn't have a thumb.
- CONT: Under the trash basket, Fredi climbs down a single flight of stairs,
  but subsequent shots show two flights of stairs there.
- CONT: From the outside, the subway train is dark, but from the inside, the
  lights are flickering.
- CONT: When Jeschag handcuffs Wiltraud to the pole in the subway, we are shown a
  closeup of his two hands, neither of which contains the dead man's handle.
- CONT: When the train tipped over, Wiltraud should have landed on the pole,
  not Fredi.
- CONT: 'Fred Erlbeck' (qv)'s character is referred to as ``Lieutenant Etli''
  throughout the film, but in the credits the character is listed as
  ``Captain Etli.''
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- FAIR: The plane clearly has no windows, and yet debris after the explosion
  includes window panes.  Most aircraft are designed for both freight and
  passenger use, and the internal structure of the fuselage includes the
  window-shaped holes seen in the debris.
