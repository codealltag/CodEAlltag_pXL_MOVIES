Hallo,


Faengt man mal an, wird es zur Sucht...

Im Archiv der New York Times habe ich - so als Schmankerl
zwischendurch - eine Kritik von 1977 zu "Star Wars" gefunden. Ein paar
Zitate:

"Star Wars," [...] is the most elaborate, most expensive, most
beautiful movie serial ever made. [...]

The story of "Star Wars" could be written on the head of a pin and
still leave room for the Bible. It is, rather, a breathless succession
of escapes, pursuits, dangerous missions, unexpected encounters, with
each one ending in some kind of defeat until the final one. [...]

[R2D2 & C3PO:]They are the year's best new comedy team. [...]

I suspect that much of the time the actors had to perform with special
effects that were later added in the laboratory. Yet everyone treats
his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor
that avoids condescension.[...]

[und der letzte ist der schoenste Satz:]
"Star Wars" is good enough to convince the most skeptical 8-year-old
sci-fi buff, who is the toughest critic. 

Gruss,
Otto

findet man eine - durchaus positive - Kritik zu Episode 1. Fuer mich
die Kernsaetze: 

Vorenkamps new opus is only a movie. 

Nikolaus still champions wondrous visions over bleak ones and sustains
his love of escapist fun. There's no better tour guide for a trip back
to the future.
