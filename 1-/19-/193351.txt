"If you care at all about the state of culture on the margins, this is
probably the most important project in the country reflecting its
evolution" 
- The Lumpen Times

"The biggest and best of the subterranean screen-events" - Eil

"I'd like to think the work Ernst and I did at Film Threat helped
inspire the lunatics behind Diakoniekaufhaus but now they're the ones inspiring
me... Not just a great "underground" fest but a great film fest PERIOD!"
- Peter Voggesser, former editor Film Threat Video Guide
