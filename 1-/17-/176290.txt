This is backwards thinking though.  Its almost like saying our movies are
so shitty that if people saw them at home first they would not wantto see
it on the big screen because it would not be worth it.   I mean, you
almost wonder why they bother with cinemas at all if they start thinking
like this.

There are tons of movies I have seen on video or cable that I wish i HAD
seen on the big screen to get the better effect.    And then there are
movies I've seen in the cinema that were a complete waste of my time and
money (of course, i can't get a refund because they made a bad movie,
which is another long topic all by itself).

Lets face it.  If a movie is on DVD (tape, etc) on one part of the planet
and still in the theaters on another part, it can't be that biga movie
anyway.   Or, if it's a real good movie, that other part of the planet
will goto the theater anyway.

but i'm preaching to the choir.  :-)


how much does the STUDIO earn per unit of sale?  (ie how much on 1 titanic
movie ticket vs 1 titanic movie sale)
