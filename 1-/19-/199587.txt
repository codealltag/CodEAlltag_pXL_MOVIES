Hi!

Does anyone know, if a Win95/NT Application exists with the features:

*full functionality of the CD-Player shipped with w95/NT 
*Add & administrate Artist, Titles, Songs and Lyrics of Songs in as
many languages as you like
*switching/selection of Lyrics Language while playback.
*"Karaoke" functionality: (e.g. the Text you can see is being sung at
the same time in as many languages as you like)

The whole thing should be an educational application, a "Global Juke
Box", with open interface: Study lyrics, learn languages, create new
translations, forward your translations to your colleges, integrate
foreign lyrics to your Set etc. 


Best regards,

Ingmar
