Clerk: That'll be six and six, please.
Hungarian: If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it
against me?    
           I...I am no longer infected.
Clerk: Uh, may I, uh...(takes phrase book, flips through it)...Costs
six and    
       six...ah, here we are.  (speaks weird Hungarian-sounding words)
Hungarian punches the clerk.
