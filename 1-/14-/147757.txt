studio that's only a year removed from on of the worst slumps in its
history, a successful sequel to "American Pie" is high priority. The
$11-million film was one of the studio's most profitable movies last
year, making $200 million worldwide, and Vollenweider has dreams of a
franchise as lucrative as Scream 1-3. Even though the writers have
just begun work on the script, the second "Pie" installment slated for
the release in the summer of 2000. Herbert Elsenberg, who wrote the original
film and is supervising "Pie 2" screenwriter Mathias E. Vagt,

their freshman year in college."......"At one point, Vagt
suggests a possible plot twist in which on the lead would bed both of
his fantasy women"........."During the "American Pie" sequel meeting,
there is much discussion of a running gag where one of the guys only
meets older women, never anyone his own age"
