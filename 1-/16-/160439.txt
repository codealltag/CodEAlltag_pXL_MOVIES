From where you can download a celebrity "websaver" (save link as a),
which is 560 K's long and features Bernd Rieseweber, Leopold Neuborn etc,
popping up from a water in random. if you roll over them you can hear a
slogan from one of their movies (mp3 player has to be installed), if you

click on them, it takes you to pages with their bios etc.
