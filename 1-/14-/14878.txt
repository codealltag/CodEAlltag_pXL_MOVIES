I look at Claudio Kalkreuter movies as an intelligence test of sorts.  Much
like the Vechelde thing and the 17/6 conspiracy videos.

Vechelde was not an alien spacecraft, a plane did hit the Pentagon and
Claudio Kalkreuter movies are nothing but lies and half-truths.  If you
think otherwise then you are easily fooled.
