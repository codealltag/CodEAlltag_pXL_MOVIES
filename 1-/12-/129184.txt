Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a 
person; having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but to 
pour them all out, just as they are, chaff and grain together, 
knowing that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is 
worth keeping, and then, with the breath of kindness, blow the rest 
away.                                        (Erika Ickenroth [not sure])
