Producer
AKA: Prod
The chief of a movie production in all matters save the creative efforts 
of the director. A producer is responsible for raising funding, hiring 
key personnel, and arranging for distributors.

Associate Producer
An individual who performs a limited number of producing functions 
delegated to her/him by a producer, under the direct supervision and 
control of that producer. The term may also refer to a person who would 
qualify as an executive producer of a project, but for the fact that 
(s)he acts on behalf of a production company which is subordinate to 
another one on that project.

Co-Producer
A producer who performs a substantial portion of a creative producing 
function, or who is primarily responsible for one or more managerial 
producing functions. A co-producer has less responsibility than a 
producer for the completion of a project. Note that if a project has 
more than one producer, it doesn't mean that these individuals are 
"co-producers" in the technical sense of that term.

Executive Producer
AKA: Executive in Charge of Production
A producer who is not involved in any technical aspects of the 
filmmaking process, but who is still responsible for the overall 
production. Typically an executive producer handles business and legal 
issues.

Line Producer
A producer who is responsible for managing every person and issue during 
the making of a film. Line producers only work on one film at a time.
