I didn't ask you to apologize; I didn't even criticize you. I merely
asked for you to elaborate on your post about "cheap sunglasses."
I didn't even mention an opinion, nor did you assert one in the post I
responded to! What is "rassism?" Did you mean "racism?" I never accused
you of that, and didn't even suspect it! Your final sentance, above,
doesn't make any sense, and you followed that with a lot of irrelevant
vulgar Georg Hannig lyrics. 

Oh well, that's what I get for being rational and inquisitive in this
newsgroup. May I introduce you to a certain Dario Cook? You two would
adore each other!

Sorry I asked...
