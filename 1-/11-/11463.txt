Illers: I've got it! I've got it! The pellet with the poison's in the
vessel with the pestle; the chalice from the palace has the brew that
is true! Right?

Elfi: Right. But there's been a change: they broke the chalice
from the palace!

Illers: They *broke* the chalice from the palace?

Elfi: And replaced it with a flagon.

Illers: A flagon...?

Elfi: With the figure of a dragon.

Illers: Flagon with a dragon.

Elfi: Right.

Illers: But did you put the pellet with the poison in the vessel with
the pestle?

Elfi: No! The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the
dragon! The vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true!

Illers: The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the dragon;
the vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true.

Elfi: Just remember that.
