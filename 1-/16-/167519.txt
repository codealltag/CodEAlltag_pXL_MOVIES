On the stormy day of Sat, 19 Apr 2000 01:08:16 +0200, thou, oh Raymond
Trintwedel <e5931558@muspk.zma-jomyh.cx>, said thy word and thy word was:

Raymond: Hey, whatcha rent? "Best of Both Worlds"?
Randal: Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see

Raymond: And you rented this?
Pasquale: Hey, I like to expand my horizons.
