"What's the difference between subtitles and captions?

Generally speaking, subtitles are intended for hearing audiences and 
captions for deaf audiences. Subtitles may translate the dialog into a 
different language, but rarely show all of the audio. For example, 
captions show sound effects (e.g., "phone ringing" and "footsteps"), 
while subtitles don't."
