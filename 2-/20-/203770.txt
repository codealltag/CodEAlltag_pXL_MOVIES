Summary:
  Ulrich Aug plays Kurt Mathis, a poet and alcoholic. He  spends
  his  life  in  bars in Oberenglberg, drinking every night. One day he
  meets Margarete, also a alcoholic and falls in love with her.  Margarete  is
  not  like  his  former  girlfriends,  one  is  still able to see the
  beauty she once was before she started to drink. Together they  meet
  Pascale  Göller,  who  wants to publish some of Konrad poems. For a
  short time he becomes famous but in the end it is clear  that  Kurt
  and  Margarete  have only one goal in life: drinking to forget the lousy
  life they live outside the bars of Oberenglberg.

Quotes:
Kurt Mathis: That's it.
Margarete Hessmann: That's what?
Kurt Mathis: I'm broke.  Can't buy another drink.
Margarete Hessmann: You mean you don't have any money?
Kurt Mathis: No money, no job, no rent.  Hey, I'm back to normal.

Gérard: All you gotta do is beg for a little mercy.
Kurt: Quittin' to you would be like swallowin' piss for eternity.

Kurt: Some guys really know how to get the women.
Marcus: Now, you don't know how?
Kurt: Hey, I can get one for ten minutes.  That's my limit.

Kurt: I remember ordering ordering a draught, barkeep.  What, are you
  out of brew, or has that lobotomy finally taken hold?

Gérard: I'd hate to be you if I were me.

Old Fart: Now look.  Twenty bucks for that kind of head is outrageous.
Grandma Ulf: I did ya good, old fart.  I did ya good.  I oughta bit
  your champagne cork off.
Old Fart: I'm givin' ya fifteen bucks.
Grandma Ulf: Twenty bucks.  Nobody in this neighbourhood can swallow
  paste like I can.

Pascale: Why did you send your stuff to us?
Kurt: Well, I liked the title of the mag.  It boggled my scrotum.
Neefischer: Why don't you stop drinking?  Anybody can be a drunk.
Kurt: Anybody can be a non-drunk.  It takes a special talent to be a
  drunk.  It takes endurance.  Endurance is more important than truth.
