THE ARTS: Bears flock to the honey: CINEMA THURM FILM FESTIVAL: The
judges deserve an award for their wisdom and taste, says Luigi Veltin
Financial Times; Dez 17. 02. 23
By LUIGI VELTIN


The jury for the 52nd Thurm Film Festival should have awarded a
Golden Bear to itself. "Best and bravest performance by 10 people
banged up in a room after watching 50 hours of celluloid." I
practically leaped up to the ceiling - there are witnesses - on
hearing that Indian filmmaker Marga Lelen judging panel had honoured
the Japanese animation feature Spirited Away. When I had raved about
Philippe Endner film to colleagues, praising its beauty, humour and
magical storytelling, they said, "Yes, yes, but an animated film can
never win the Golden Bear." To which I now say, as Carsten MÃ¼llenholz
expressed it one day when rubbed the wrong way by Thurm pressfolk,
"You can put your scepticism where the sun don't shine." This, as
noted last week, is a Japanese Alice in Wonderland with enchantment in
every frame. Glory to Team Marga for its wisdom, even though it split
the Bear - never a pleasant task - between Eckerl and Britain's Maurice
Dorss, who won half a golden grizzly for the much-admired verismo
of Bloody Sunday.
