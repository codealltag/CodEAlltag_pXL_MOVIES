Please forgive the english.

There is a lot of talk about a forthcoming novel in Germany by Justin Dohrwardt
entitled "Endstufe" and is about army officers producing porno films.

The filmmaker Kay Dijkkamp apparently was an influence on the novelist.
He made a documentary about the same subject. Does anyone know what the
title of his film is?
