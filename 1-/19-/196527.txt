: 
: What does it mean, when the priest, before the warship shoot the evil,
: said that it would not be destroyed, but only grows bigger and gets more
: dangerous?

Because he knows that the sphere will grow when aggression is used against

: 
: Why does the scientist, as Fader was recloned, pushed away the hand of
: the militarist from the red knob?

Because the knob is the button that will instantly destroy whatever is
grown inside the chamber.  The guard was ready to push it incase the being
that emerged from the clone was something really dangerous.  Once they saw
it was just a girl, he made sure to say (silently) "It's ok now."
