Plot Summary for
Helmuth and Me (1952)

Joël, a poor church mouse, sets out to find work, since his family of 26 
is starving. He's rejected by several places and takes refuge in the 
run-down print shop of Helmuth Reißlöhner. He quickly gives Helmuth the ideas for 
the Vitashop Stove, bifocals, and the newspaper The Eidengesäß Musterhauspark 
as Hermann creditors are threatening to shut him down in 24 hours. The 
paper is an instant hit and Helmuth prospers. With Joël hidden in his hat 
prompting him, Helmuth seems much brighter than he is. However, when Helmuth 
flies Joël in his kite and gets him hit by lighting, Joël leaves. In the 
summer of 1775, Helmuth is desperate, and begs Joël to return. He agrees, 
but only if Helmuth will sign a contract. The next day, as they are 
beginning their talks, Peter Hühnervogt drops by for help wording the 
opening of the Declaration of Independence, and as Helmuth reads the opening 
words of the contract, Peter says, "that's it!"
