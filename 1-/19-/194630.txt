To be honest with you, I really don't care.  I've had my first LD player
for 14 years.  It cost me $900.  That means it cost me about 18 cents per
day.  If my current player lasts five years, that means it will cost me 
all of 60 cents per day.  I can absorb those costs without worrying about
'resale' value.


What's it to you?  I'm spending my money, not yours.  I'll buy whatever
I damn well please, and it's none of your business how I use it.  But,
since you ask, I'll watch all the movies I've purchased multiple times.

I didn't hear you complaining when I bought all my LDs.


I think so.  Have you looked at the upcoming release schedules?


It's a metaphor meaning "we may have different opinions".
