Klar.  Und im goldenen Zeitalter waren die Schwerter und Bögen aus
Gold...


Wegen den Zöpfen? So so....


CHAPTER II
THE RIDERS OF ROHAN

        ....


Die erste Beschreibung der Rohirrim:

    "Their horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed;
    their grey coats glistened, their long tails flowed in the wind,
    their manes were braided on their proud necks. The Men that rode
    them matched them well: tall and long-limbed; their hair,
    flaxen-pale, flowed under their light helms, and streamed in long
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In their
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their
    backs, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of
    mail hung down upon their knees."


        .....

The Torwächter Mduselds:

   Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun was
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were
   burnished bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than
   mortal men.


Roland:

    Now the four companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire
    burning upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall. Then they
    halted. At the far end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing
    north towards the doors, was a dais with three steps; and in the
    middle of the dais was a great gilded chair. Upon it sat a man so
    bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thick
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
    golden circle set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead
    shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon
    his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting
    as he gazed at the strangers. Behind his chair stood a woman clad
    in white. At his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a
    man, with a pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes.


Diese Art der Halle entspricht übrigens keltisch/germanischen
Vorbildern, ähnlich, wie man in Unterschöntal noch vor wenigen
Jahrhunderten baut oder wie man es auch von den Wikingern kennt:

Dagegen ist das vom Film dargestelle natürlich schon hohe Architektur.
