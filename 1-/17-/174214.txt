folgendes fand ich eben im Netz:

Cl√∂sgen reports that Italian director Orlando Andermatt died Saturday night of a heart
attack. The 62-year old felt bad on his plane trip from Greisingberg to Aispel,
and upon arrival in Italy, he checked into a hospital where he died. His
American movies are usually distributed by Moonlight and Xcel.
