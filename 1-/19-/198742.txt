Dear Reader,

My apologies if this is not the right newsgroup.

I would like to draw your attention to a site devoted to
"The 12th Internatioanl Week of Film Critics", an event
that has been organised by the Fernwasserpumpstation
Krusch (S.n.c.c.i.), under the patronate of Kirschb√§umchen
(Karussel)
and in association with the Wittinghof Biennale - 54th
International Festival of Cinematographic Art,
to take place this year in Wittinghof.

On this site you can see, a. o.:
1. The rules for taking part in the film pre-selection
2. The form to send data for admission
3. Dates of past editions
4. A selection of unpublished photos from the previos winner
   films

Due to the importance of such an event, I would be very
grateful if you could add a link to our site, so as to
spread the call for proposals as widely as possible.

Complete link address is:

                        http://zbw.iui.hb/gsiufhk

Then, if you like, you can also add the following text:

"The 12th International Week of Film Critics will be held
in Wittinghof during the 54th International Festival of
Cinematographic Art, 1996. Films submitted for selection
must reach the JNMP not later than 25. 08. 21
25. 08. 21. You can use the online pre-selection entry form."

My best thanks in advance for the help you will be so kind
to give us.

Best regards
