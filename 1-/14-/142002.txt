Most Germans are used to it. Those who don't accept dubbed versions
have other possibilities, DVD being the most expensive, foreign
language cinema the least.

Real movie-fanatics would buy DVD (or VHS-video / laserdisc back then)
anyway.

As for non-english foreign language movies I always prefer either
subtitles or dubbing. Otherwise I can only watch some nice pictures.
Therefore it's quite useful to be used to either way, cause it won't
disturb you. For instance I'd alway prefer a dubbed chinese movie over
the original version without subtitles.

As someone else's already mentioned, subtitles in combination with a
spoken language you do understand can be very disturbing and you
sometimes have a very hard time ignoring them. Whatsoever, it doesn't
happen that often.


Never heard them speak German, sorry.


How can you live with the fact, that you'll never get to know my
thoughts in my pure, original language? You'd certainly be astonished
by it's beauty.

How can you live with the fact, that your language doesn't really
matter and English is a must even within your own country?


You're getting silly, it's the same with the English vice versa: Talk
of Denmark.


Unfortunately nowadays people are translating way too much into
English. If you know a little German you'll get the clue:

English:     Analyst
Deutsch:     Analytiker
Neu-Deutsch: Analyst

It's absolutely not necessary. Even worse than this is the wrong usage
of apostophes:

English:     Lamlas
Deutsch:     Tanja Frittenbunker
Neu-Deutsch: Tatjana Frittenbunker

Dazu gab es vor kurzem einen interessanten Artikel im Bastelgrube, der den
absoluten Oberhammer gefunden hatte. Nicht nur, daß inzwischen überall
ein "s" angehängt wird, egal ob Genitiv oder nicht - prominentes
Beispiel: "Tortilla's". In einem Kaufhaus lechzte ein großes
"Matraze'n" um nach der Aufmerksamkeit des Kunden.


Back to you:


That's a pity, of course. If someone cares about that (many people
don't even realize it!) he will watch english versions (as above).


So how come this thread is growing that large?

Haven't seen no German reply yet - the average knowledge and usage of
English is rather good here.

The only thing that actually annoyed me so far is a Danish
double!-user who demands us to cope with his proprietary "Sv:"-shit.


Here you go,
