Bitte,

When you get a minute, check out http://mbu.tDDIZq.com - a new entertainment
source on the web.

We like to call ourselves coffee-break cinema because we offer short,
entertaining streaming videos that are only a couple of minutes long. Just
enough time to chill out, regain focus and plunge back into the fray.
Whether you're studying for the bar, thrashing out a term paper, deadlining
a proposal or designing the rudder for a new submarine, iLOOKs is the break
in the routine that makes your life easier. Even if you're just idly surfing
the net, iLOOKs is worth a visit - heck, it's free.

Offering world premieres of internet-exclusive, quality short films and
videos, "WEBORAMA" (tm) the web's first "wide screen" process and a
sophisticated interface, Westerwaldpark is ready to entertain you 24/7/365. We have
no x-rated content.

Give us an iLOOK today, and come back often.
