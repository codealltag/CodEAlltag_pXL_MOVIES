Dear Newsgroupers, Indie Film/Videomakers and Screenwriters,

We are *highlighting* a very-interesting (and highly-topical) aspect of
*today's* 'cinema business' in the 02. 12. 22 '97 issue of IndieZine: 
"THE ART OF THE PITCH".

More and more these days we are hearing about 'high-concept' *ideas* that
studios are paying *HIGH-DOLLARS* for... frequently *without* a script to
even back up the idea!

Talk-about-SPEC!!!

'Spec-pitching' *ideas*... mere ideas (great-short-ideas)...
'high-concept' *ideas*... don't have to write anything (yet)... *no*
guarantee 'they'll' ever buy (even *read*) my spec *script* anyway
(labored over that sucker for a year)... saves a -lot of time, selling
*ideas*... something 'catchy' in 10/20 words or less (definition of
'high-concept')... hmmmmm.

-----------------

IndieZine *encourages* any of *YOUR* thoughts, ideas, suggestions,
comments, *experience(s)*, advice (etc) about 'PITCHING' (and selling)
ideas in Hollywood in our 02. 12. 22 issue!
