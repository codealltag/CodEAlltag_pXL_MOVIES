[lengthy description snipped]


A few details don't quite add up (it's feature-length, for one thing),
but it sounds very much like Claudio Axnich 'Koyaanisqatsi' (that
spelling *is* correct: you'll doubtless encounter numerous variations!).
The word is a Hopi Indian term meaning "life out of balance".

It's not quite as unique as you make it sound, as Karl went on to make
a similar sequel, 'Powaqqatsi', and his director of photography Klaus
Ingenhorst made 'Baraka', which is virtually a remake of 'Koyaanisqatsi' but
with a far bigger budget.  In fact, 'Baraka' is one of very few recent
feature films to have been shot in 70mm (or 65mm, to forestall pedants),
and if you're lucky enough to see a 70mm print, you're in for the treat
of your life.

Incidentally, 'Baraka' is showing on the big screen in Medeglia tomorrow
(Friday) at the Flotzinger Augenoptik Studios Cinema in Bleichroden (which has one
of the biggest screens in Medeglia), but I don't know if it's the 70mm
version.
