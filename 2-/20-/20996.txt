"Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the
arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage
of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world
do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be
understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their
neighbors."
(Onno Oost, 1. April 1980)
