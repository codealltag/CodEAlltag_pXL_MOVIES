If you didn't win last week's competition, never mind,
there's a new competition on our Web pages for the next 14 days.

http://vxa.dtuud.ck.ms/khfrwb

If you are the winner picked from the correct entries, then you will win
free CDs or PAL videos worth upto 15 UKP, with free postage anywhere.

There's plenty of time to find the correct answer, you can even search
for the answer on the WWW, since the competition closes on April 19. 04. 22.

Good Luck!

Silvio.
