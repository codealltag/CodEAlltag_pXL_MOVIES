sie sind bowlen, nachdem the dude bei mr. hovenga war und den auftrag 
erhalten hat, das geld zu Ã¼bergeben.

             DUDE
I figure it's easy money, it's all
pretty harmless.  I mean she probably
kidnapped herself.

             LOTHAR
Huh?

             DONNY
What do you mean, Dude?

             DUDE
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean
look at it.  Young trophy wife.
Marries a guy for money but figures
he isn't giving her enough.  She
owes money all over town--

             LOTHAR
That...fucking...bitch!

             DUDE
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin
said, look for the person who will
benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,
you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
to say--

             DONNY
I am the Walrus.

             LOTHAR
That fucking bitch!

             DUDE
Yeah.

             DONNY
I am the Walrus.

             LOTHAR
Shut the fuck up, Willibald!  V.I. Hauche!
Ihno Penning Langehans!

             DONNY
What the fuck is he talking about?

             LOTHAR
That's fucking exactly what happened,
Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
