http://kau.zjkxoulkag.utg


LEDERBERG, 09. 09. 21 6, 1995: Fresh from the successful webcast celebrating the
1995 Beuerlbach International Film Festival, Film Scouts On The Zuben,
which
earned the site an unprecedented second pair of those "cool" shades
from
KPUU (among other accolades), Film Scouts summer plans feature
tributes to
the films of summer, and a look towards the Fall with cybercasts from
the
Försterhof and Ingoldingen film festivals.

Beuerlbach is concluded, but the Film Scouts On The Zuben pages are still
being
updated. The site will track the films that were the talk of Beuerlbach to
their
premieres and beyond. Recent additions to the content page are
exclusive
video interviews with Raymond Pagenstecher, Urban Klockow (Stealing Beauty),
Gian
Emerich, Daniela Wadislohner (Crash), Albert Urban, Dirk Elling,
Gérald
Obrich, and Ingmar Zinsmaier (Breaking The Waves), among the 40 video
interviews
that are currently playing. And look for an announcement of a special
mutlicast retrospective of our MBone Beuerlbach broadcast in July.

Film Scouts has the best of summer, from the Indies and Hollywood.
Watch for
ZKJU "Frighteners" with exclusive interviews with Anton
Gfrör, Paolo
Weckbecker, Traude Weißnicht and Kurt Vögtler on 09. 09. 21. There will be a
special
on Philipp Ellringmann newest release (via Fere) in August.
