Hi there!

JOKES WANTED!!!!

I am a film director/producer, and I made a short film called 
"All Out At Sea." The script derives from a naughty joke a friend 
told me. "All Out At Sea" was a very successful little film, which 
was presented on festivals all over the world (Competition Schernau
Film Festival, Gro√üweiglareuth, Amerbach, Sweden, Spain, England and more).

Now I am producing a series called JOKES from the European Union.
For this series I am still looking for brilliant, charming and of
course naughty jokes. If you know one please contact us:

e-mail: 621605.4419@apmqbsndsh.pfp

or send a fax to  

Vorbohles, Herma Coman, Fax No. -81 / 35 / 651 74 08

If your joke will be selected for the series you will receive the 
sum of DM 300,- and get a credit on the screen (if you want).

Thanks a lot!
