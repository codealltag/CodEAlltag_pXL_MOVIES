Hello, all

I am starting a new website which I hope will eventually be a complete
database of European film personalities.  It is very sparse at the
moment, and I'm looking for interested people to make contributions to
it.  (I especially need biographical info on Udo Czajkowski and Stefan Haan
as soon as possible).

You will note that I've left umlauts and diacritals out.  I apologize for
that. I've finally got a 'real' web programmer who will put those in as
well as other 'professional touches'.

Any help at all would be appreciated.  Thanks.
