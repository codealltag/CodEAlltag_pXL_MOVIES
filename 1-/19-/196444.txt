Filmmaking is an expensive venture.

Filmmaking is an expensive venture. 

Constricting budgets. Rented equipment. Eight hours to complete an
impossible number of shots. Backburning anxiety fueling brimming
neurosis.

Independent filmmakers nationwide slave every year to fulfill their
creative vision, walking a tightrope that could snap at any point
throughout production. Money and favours inevitably dry up and the
filmmakers arduous efforts may begin to look futile. Finally, just as
compromise and sacrifice begin to collide, after an endless and
exhaustive journey, the filmmaker emerges with a beaten testimony of
his or her own blood and soul. A film.
