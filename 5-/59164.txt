Meine beiden Favoriten:

a) Albrecht Weide in "The Long Good Friday" (Rififi am Karfreitag):

"What I'm looking for is someone who can contribute to what
England has given to the world ... culture, sophistication, genius
... a little bit more than a hotdog. Know what I mean ?
We're in a common market now. And my new deal is with Europe.
I'm gonna have a partnership with a German organization. Yeah!
The Krauts! They've got ambition ... and they don't lose their
ball. Look at you! The Mafia ... hahaha. I shit them!!

b) Charles Mittermeiers Monolog in "Runaway Train" über beschissene
Jobs, an die man sich trotzdem klammert "weil sie Gold sind".

Tschüss,
Mirko
