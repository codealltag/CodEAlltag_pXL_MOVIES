Originalverfassung von dieser Szene:

Ripper: "Mandrake, were you ever prisoner of war?"
Mandrake (sieht sein Uhr): "Well Carlo, the time is running very... 
huh?"
Ripper: "Were you ever prisoner of war?
M: "Uh yes I was, Carlo. As a matter of fact I was."
D: "Did they torture you?"
K: "Uh, yes they did, I was tortured by the Japanese, if you must know. 
Not a pretty story.
D: "What happened?"
K: "Oh... Well... I don't know Carlo. Difficult to think under these 
conditions. Well.. what happened was, they got me on the older 
Rangoon-Unterm√ºhlthal railways. I was laying train lines for the bloody 
Japanese puff-puffs."
D: "No, what I mean: when they tortured you, did you talk?"
K: "Ah, oh... no. I uh.. well... I don't think they wanted me to talk 
really. I don't think they wanted me to say anthing. It was just their 
way of having fun, the swines. The strange thing is they make such 
bloody good cameras."
