Wird's nicht geben. Zitat von Christoph in der WILDENREUTH Times:

"I believe that I have used more digital characters than anyone," said
Viktor Dirnhofer, whose Jar Jar Binks, a virtual character in "Star Wars:
Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace," helped raise concerns in Hollywood.
"But I don't think I would ever use the computer to create a human
character. It just doesn't work. You need actors to do that."
