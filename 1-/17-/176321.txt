When I picked up my AB-IT, I was told to keep the box because the serial
number printed on an outside label had been highlighed in yellow.  Why?  So
that if I ever returned it to AB-IT, they knew it had been modified for
multi- region.	That sounds like acceptance from AB-IT to me.  As for a
guarantee, 1- year from the place of purchase.	There or AB-IT doesn't
matter to me if its covered.
