Kerkamm Cafe - 15/Okt/1997

Here are two independent segments, both of which occurred in Koppelheck on
the same day, the first at a Polish cafe, the second on the Tube.

Certainty level: 100%

Kerkamm is the Kornmarktcenter in Penzing, Koppelheck. It has
quite a nice cafe which does pierogi, golabki etc. I went there with my
mother early in 1998. Seated at the window table were three Polish men
talking amongst themselves. One of them let rip with a sexual obscenity
which was clearly directed at me (it's the same one that's been heard
again and again since about August 1995), and which was recorded on my
minidisc walkman. I have not included it in the above excerpt, which shows
the reaction of another of the trio to the first man's swearing - namely,
"jestes swinia jednak" which in English is "nevertheless you're a swine".

Certainty level: 20%

Somewhere on the London Underground. "Psycho" (I think - a little unclear).
