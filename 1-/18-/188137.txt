Hi!

We are pleased to let you know that the DVD-Charger 'upgrade' for your
DVD-player has become quite cheaper! We have new end-user prices and
new dealer / distributor prices. 

Please note that no one has received the product for our previous
prices. These are now the *final* prices and we're ready to take
orders.

You can now also find the DVD-Charger user manual and installation
manual on our site.

Best regards,
DVD-Charger Team
