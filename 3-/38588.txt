Hi,

Sorry for interrupting this topic (and for not speaking German ;), but
I am searching for the film "Es herrscht Ruhe im Land", which is in
this list!

Does anyone have any idea of how to get this film?

Basically, part of "Es herrscht Ruhe im Land" was filmed at my
grandparent's house in the 1970s, and they never got to see the film.
I am trying to find the film to show them!

Thanks!
