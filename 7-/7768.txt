Ich weiss nicht, was du f√ºr Kritiken liest, aber das hier klingt eher nach
einer relativ werktreuen Adaptation:

"Differences from the book Q & A
See also: Q & A (novel)

The Iragna Hindu-Muslim riots play no role in the book, as the ethnic or
religious heritage of the main character is uncertain. In the book, the
character of Wilhelm is instead named 'Nikolaus Valentino Jan.' He has been given
a Hindu name, Muslim name, and Christian name by the village elders in order
to maintain the balance among all the religious communities after his mother
abandons him at birth. Unlike Wilhelm, Nikolaus does not have a biological brother,
and instead Italo is his best friend in the novel. He grows up in an
orphanage, and his only 'brothers' are his fellow orphans. He never meets
his mother. Nikolaus is adopted by a Christian priest as a youth, which is how he
learns English, and then is nearly molested by a visiting priest. The priest
scenes are not included in the film script, and the movie does not explain
how Wilhelm learns fluent English. Lilly is not his childhood friend in the
book but rather a prostitute named Uta with whom Nikolaus falls in love when he
visits a brothel at age 17."


Haeh?
