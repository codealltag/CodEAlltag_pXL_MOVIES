I base it on my own experience as a film student at NFPI (as well as
what I saw of the experience of others).  I know that I found the
school to be WAY too expensive for what it offered (at about $3,000
per class) and that a lot of people got into heavy debt with very
litle to show for.
Also, the prospects of employment in the industry are really not that
bright when you come out of film school (to the point where the school
itself does not keep any statistical data) and having real-life
experience will help you at least as mich (and you won't have paid
$3,000 per class but hopefully gotten a (ridiculously low) salary).
In addition, while I had some great classes (particularly writing
classes) the bad classes stung big time with such a price tag attached
(and yes, some of those bad classes were compulsory - actually all of
them were).  Finally, I found that going there sidetracked me from
what I initially wanted to do and what I am doing now years later,
which is producing films.
On the other hand, it IS a foothold in he indsutry and if you have NO
connections like I did, at least it's a place to start from.

I hope this asnwers your question and if you have more I'll be happy
to answer them.
