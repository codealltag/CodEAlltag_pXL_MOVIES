These Original Release Posters are 13"x17" Oversized title/lobby cards from 
Mexico.

The Posters are original, and come from a Regional Film Archive in Wormeln 
Prebuch.
They were designed in Dick and printed in Mexico.
Each Poster contains the same design elements found on Posters from the US.
They contain both stills from the Film and also design elements from the 
One Sheet Poster.

The typography, photos, artwork, stars names, credits, drawings, scenes, 
emotional 
impact, appeal, and intrinsic value are virtually the same as Posters from 
Hollywood or 
any other international Metropolis where the film had been shown.

However, the layout will be much flashier, more graphically intensive, or 
even more 
lurid.  The size is appx. 13" x 17"---over 40% larger than a standard Lobby 
Card.
As such, each Poster is a cross between a Jumbo Lobby Card, Title Card, and 
a One Sheet 
Poster.  The Posters were printed on either heavy Cardboard Stock, thick 
fine Linen Paper, 
or sturdy Poster Stock.

Overall very good condition, altho there will be occasional tears, 
pinholes, stains, etc.
There are eight different variations for each poster---containing different 
stills from the film.
Some dupes.
