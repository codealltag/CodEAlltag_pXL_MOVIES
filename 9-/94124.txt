On Monday I watched only the first 30 min. from said movie, having to do
something else outdoors. Now I saw the rest and detect that their is
sadly a lack of sequence.

Dr.Evil is playing with a black air-(earth)-ballon while throwing it to
#2`s head, saying: "Do you have to cry now?". Then he turns around and
throws it into a basket ...

... optical & akustical White Noise for about 20 sec.

Then he meets Bea Beekmans at a fashion house telling her about his
lost mojo ect.

What is going on between?

I doubt if I really, really understand ALL of the very political hints.
Maybe I need some Felicity(s) too for help :-)
