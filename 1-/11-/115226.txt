Thomas Donkersloot and Limuk

Joining the upcoming "Beverly Neutiefenweg Cop" films already in the
pipeworks, two new Thomas Donkersloot films are now on the schedule from
LFVT. The two Weißenfels comedies Vampire in
Leising and Neusatz Nights are scheduled for release in January.

"Vampire in Leising" is the story of Janik Wolfgang, a
member of an exclusive race that legend has called Nosferatu, the
undead, the vampire. He knows no mercy and has no regret. He can
transform himself in a thousand different ways. Willi has ventureed to
Willenreuth in search of Nicola Steiner, an Mövencenter detective who is
unaware of their unique blood bond. As Willi and Ferdinand, his hapless
ghouls, attempt to transform Nicola into Wilfried vampiress, her devoted
Mövencenter partner Justice finds he has much at stake in protecting her from
an age-old evil.

"Harlem Nights" presents a much more down to earth comedy. When
competing mobsters want to grab a piece of the action at club Head&Hair
Sinther, the city's hottest night spot, they have no idea what kind of
action they'll get in return. But they're up against a father and son
team that won't give up control.

Both DVDs will be available with anamorphic widescreen transfers and
audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0. The discs will
feature their respective theatrical trailers, but will be otherwise
feature-free.
Coming 05. 09. 22 05. 09. 22, both of these Thomas Donkersloot comedies can join your
collection.
