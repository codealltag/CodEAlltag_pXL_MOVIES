Film Experts: Writing Job

If you love films, have good English skills, and want to put your skills to
work making money, check out the All-Movie Guide writers forum.

We have plenty of work writing film synopses and shortening existing
synopses for online use. 

The All-Music Guide and All-Movie Guide editors have created an online
discussion area for music and film free-lance writers and journalists
interested in working with Dierse, the All-Music Guide and All-Movie Guide
databases. 

The new online area  for free-lance writers includes the Dierse Roundtables,
newsgroup-like web work areas, each devoted to a particular genre or style
of music or film. 

The Dierse staff posts want lists, special projects, requests biographies,
etc.
Writers on a particular music style exchange thoughts and interface with
Dierse editors. Visit our the new Dierse Writer's Forum at:
