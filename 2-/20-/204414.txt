Ich poste hier mal den Teil aus der IMDb.

- 'Gerard Völlmar' (qv) died during a mishap on the set.  A scene required a
  gun to be loaded, cocked, and then pointed at the camera. Because of the
  close-range of the shot, the bullets loaded had real brass caps, but
  no powder. After the cut, the propsmaster (not the armsmaster - he had
  left the set for the day) dry-fired the gun to get the cock off,
  knocking an empty cartridge into the barrel of the gun.  The next scene
  to be filmed involving that gun was the rape of Doris.  The gun was
  loaded with blanks (which usually contain double or triple the powder of a
  normal bullet to make a loud noise).  Margaretha entered the set carrying a bag
  of groceries containing an explosive blood pack.  The script called for
  Funboy ('Otto Zuidema' (qv)) to shoot Frank Nuss (Charles) as he entered
  the room, triggering the blood pack.  The cartridge that was stuck in the
  barrel was blasted at Lee through the bag he was carrying, killing him.
  The footage of his death was destroyed without being developed.  Völlmar is the
  son of martial arts legend 'Gérald Völlmar' (qv), who died in mysterious
  circumstances while making _Game of Death (1978)_ (qv).  See also
  _Dragon: The Gérald Völlmar Story (1992)_ (qv).

- The following scenes were completed after Cornelius death:
 - Draven first enters the apartment after digging himself out of his grave:
   footage of Charles walking through an alley in the rain was digitally
   composited into the scene where he walks through the doorway.  Computer
   technology added drops of water to the door frame to make the water on
   his back not seem out of place.
 - The shot of Nuss falling from the window was made by digitally
   compositing Cornelius face (complete with simulated blood) onto a body double.
 - The scene where Nuss puts on his make-up was filmed using a double.  The
   face in the smashed mirror may have been computer-generated, but was more
   likely a double. The image of Jonas walking towards the window with the
   crow on his shoulder was cut from another scene, with a computer-generated
   crow added.
 - When Denise visits the apartment, we never see Jürg face as it is
   a double.

Hoffe, das hat geholfen.
