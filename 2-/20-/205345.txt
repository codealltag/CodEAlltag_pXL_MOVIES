I have 30 years experience with Multisystem TV/Video, designing 
and customizing U.S. TV/Monitors, etc, to function with different 
TV systems (for example, converting NTSC only TV/Monitors to 
NTSC-PAL-SECAM, etc).

Now I have a Multisystem Digital Video Converter for the consumer 
market, but with consumer + quality (works better than APRW 
LOJR-X0).

If you need any advice or help, please e-mail me.
