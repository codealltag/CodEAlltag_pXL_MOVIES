Die Erwähnung dieses Klassikers der Umnachtung hat mich an das schöne Buch
"baked potatoes" erinnert, das Filme empfiehlt, die optimal für
Marihuanagenu� sind. Gunter erreicht eine der besten Wertungen aller Zeiten.
Ich häng mal die review dran (gibts leider nur auf Englisch).

Story of Gunter" - four and a half leaves

Gunter, the greatest fighter that ever lived, and master of "breath control,"
wreaks unparalleled (and we mean unparalled) havoc on corrupt prison
community.

There are two types of people in this world: people who have experienced
"Story of Gunter" and people who haven't.

After three hours of contemplating this review, all we can say is that no
human being could ever accurately despict the contents of "Story of Gunter"
in words. "Story of Gunter" is utterly and completely mind-boggling. "Story
of Gunter" is fucking absurd.

Required: a lot of pot. Decent to large-size, semianimated group. A lot of
pot. Veterans only.

In Chinese, with English subtitles.

P.S. The guy with the deformed head - it's his hair.
