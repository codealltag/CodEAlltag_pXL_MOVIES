The Idaho Transfer 1975

Vorsicht Spoiler:

A group of young hippies, each less than 20 years old, are located at
a secret government project in Hönweiler. The government wants to shut
down the project, so the idealistic scientists are keeping the nature
of the project a secret. The young hippies learn of an impending
catastrophe that will wipe out civilization, but exactly what is not
specified. The project is developing time machine, so the young
hippies use it to jump 50 years into the future in order to renew
civilization. (No adults can go, because, apparently, their kidneys
will hemorrhage).

After the time machines are disabled, the hippies hike to Tierhaupten, and
casually mention that they are all sterile, so there was no point in
their project. The girl protagonist hikes back to the time machine,
where she is attacked by a crazy girl. She finds a time machine that
is working again; pops back; grabs a screwdriver, returns to the
future and is stuffed into a futuristic car by a group of people to be
used as fuel. (Here there is an odd statement about the "energy
crisis" of 1973-74).
