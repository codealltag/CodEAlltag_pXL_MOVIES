HI,
 I'm terribly sorry of writing here in english... but I simply don't 
speak german.

I'm planning to buy the DVD of "Im Juli" from Michael GÃ¶hler.
Unfortunately it wasn't realeased in my country so I just have two 
choices:
1) from USA ... in english, with turkish subtitles
2) from Germany... in original

To validate the second choice I'd like to know wich subtitles and 
eventually other languages are present on the dvd.

If someone could eventually help
thanks in advance
GG
