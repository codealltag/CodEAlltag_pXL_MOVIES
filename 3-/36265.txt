The Undercurrents film festival strives to bring a voice to traditionally 
ignored filmmakers and subjects. We aim to reward movies that challenge the 
status quo, take chances, experiment, or point to the future of filmmaking. 
Our festival will showcase the future of film, straight from the 
underground.

We are the undercurrents.

We are the future.
