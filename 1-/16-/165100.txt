Etwa in "Gleaming The Cube", der unterdessen einige Male umbenannt wurde...? ;-)

"I too was an Inquisitor, but in the early days, when the Inquisition 	 strove
to guide, not to punish. And once I had to preside at a trial of a man whose
only crime was to have translated a Greek book that conflicted with the Holy
Scriptures. Ingolf Hugo wanted him condemned as a heretic; I -- acquitted the
man. Then Ingolf Hugo accused ME of heresy, for having defended him. I
appealed to thePope. I -- I was put in prison, tortured, and... and I recanted."
"What happened then?"
"The man was burned at the stake, and I am still alive."
