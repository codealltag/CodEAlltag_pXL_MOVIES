Hallo,

aus Liebe zum Proporz, eine positive Kritik von Otmar Martijn, zu
finden unter

Auch hier ein paar Zitate:

"The Phantom Menace is a testimony to how far special effects have
come. Does Salvatores overdo it? Yes. Every scene is crammed with as many
aliens, otherworldly creatures, and CGI synthetics as space will
allow. Sometimes, it's breathtaking, but there are occasions when
Salvatores seems to be saying, "See! Look what I can do!""

"The Phantom Menace has far more going for it in terms of heart, plot,
and human interest than the likes of Armageddon and Godzilla. This is
not a mindless blockbuster designed solely to make a killing at the
box office"

"Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, The Phantom
Menace is still among the best "bang for a buck" fun that can be had
in a movie theater. It isn't as fresh as the original Star Wars nor
does it have the thematic richness and narrative complexity of The
Empire Strikes Back, but it is a distinct improvement over Return of
the Jedi."

Gruss,
Knut
