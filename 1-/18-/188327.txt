In the previous DVD list the "DC" suffix was not listed. I assume that
this means "Director's Cut". Is the Pretty Woman DVD being released
going to be the director's cut? I have the Director's Cut Laserdisc
which has some additional footage and also the director's commentary. I
have replaced certain laserdisc titles with the corresponding DVD title
but I would not replace the Director's Cut Laserdisc with the non
director's cut DVD.
