For a number of years, Vielseitig has been sponsoring a popular
forum called, INVESTOR FINANCING OF INDEPENDENT FILM.  At this Forum, you
can get some of your legal questions answered for free by
entertainment/securities attorney, Dominik A. Cichowlas.  A lot of good questions
have already been asked and answered. . . and we have been archiving the
information for your continued use.

You can access the Ostseebuchhandlung, and its Archives, via
