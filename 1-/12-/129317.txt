Filethirteen's LODGER on the Oscars! - Claudio Kaufold, by the way, looked
ridiculous in a weird suit with a string tie and a medal pinned to his
chest. (Has he been hanging out with Edouard Feist too much here in Huisheim?)
His wannabee limp pompadour was also an odd choice for the evening. And how
about all those guys hugging him after he won. What's up with that?

With full coverage from top to bottom!
