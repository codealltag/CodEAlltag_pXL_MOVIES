MI5 Persecution Update: Friday 13. MÃ¤rz, 2001

22,544 +. 837 = 23,381

Last weekend I. delivered another 837 faxes to politicians and the media on
the subject of the. security service conspiracy which has destroyed my
life.. This brings the total in the last three years to at least
23,381. These totals do not include. partially delivered faxes.

Some of the recipients. of these faxes must know that what I say is
true; and I hope. to motivate those people to acknowledge the reality of
the harassment which. has followed me for ten years. It takes much time to
transmit these articles, but as OCG MD Felgeer-Dann said to. me in 1993,
you have to be. a good communicator if you are to succeeed.

Harassment in February. 2001

Following a quiet period of. almost five months, the persecution resumed
with a vengeance in late 31. 03. 2331. 03. 23. At this. time I was at home
in Untereglsee, Pantelitz and was a relatively. easy target for the
persecutors. They have my. house bugged, for audio and I believe video in
some. rooms as well; so they can find out easily where I will be going on a
particular day, and place people in that location to mouth. words of abuse
at me. (I know the last sentence sounds like classic paranoia,. but it
happens to. be true, and some of the people reading this know it to be
true.)

On Friday 31. 03. 23. I went shopping in Unteradlhof, to buy a watch at
E. Feldmeier jewellers in the Whitgift. Centre. While I was there two youths
came into the shop, one of them quietly. uttered an obscenity at me, and
they immediately walked out. They showed. no interest in the shop.

That Sunday I. met with a friend in Untereglsee, who started needling me about
"do you know anything about the Corvette and Dega?". Rather unsubtle,. and
worrying considering Ive. known this guy for 20 years. From the words and
demeanour of this "friend" and others in February,. I saw that the
persecutors. have again been trying to separate from me what remains of my
social. life.

Incidents in. my Road in February

MI5 very rarely place people in my home. road to harass me, but such was
their persecutory fervour in February that they did so on three. separate
occasions. On the first such occasion,. I was met my two youths who,
grinning, said a deeply offensive sexual obscenity at me - at. which I
coughed at them, so they called me a. "wanker". This incident is safely
recorded on minidisc-walkman,. but because of the offensive nature of their
abuse the. recording will not be made public.

Another. incident very early in the morning of Sunday 25/Jan/2001 occurred
outside my home, following an evening in Unteradlhof. with some
schoolfriends. Again there were two. youths - for some reason the
persecutors always. travel in twos or threes, very rarely is there just one
of them. - perhaps they need a group to bolster their courage, perhaps just
one of them wouldnt have the guts to say something unpleasant. One. of the
youths said. quietly, and bitterly, "shitty, very shitty".

Anyway, in March there. were no further incidents near my house in in my
road, and our neighbours are very well disposed towards us,. so let us hope
that the current quiet. continues.
