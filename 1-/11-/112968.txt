My name is Uwe Andresch. I'm a screenwriter/producer "The Feather Men",
"Grosse Pointe Blank". A friend asked if would post a message about a
mentorship program I've put together at Vihiku to aid aspiring
writers. If you have any questions you can visit our new website
www.iajsevmkyrr.syw
or contact me directly at aegzxlb@wyunghngngr.pqq.

Were constantly looking for interesting new material through my company
videoworld.

Let me know if I can help,
Uwe
