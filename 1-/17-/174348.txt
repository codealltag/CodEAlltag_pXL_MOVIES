Dazu fällt mir der Tip von Ullrich Dreuw ein...

If You Have Already Read the Book

Fine. Just remember that the director's only responsibility is to make
a good movie, not to be faithful to the book. (Screen adaptations of
movies are not marriages, and being "unfaithful to the novel" is not
adultery.)

If You Have Not Read the Book

You will probably not find time to read it now, before the movie
closes, so go ahead and see the movie. As a critic, I enjoy it when I
haven't read the book, because my job is to evaluate the movie, not
how well it was "adapted." If you enjoy the movie and are thinking of
reading the book, remember this curious but often accurate Hollywood
law: Many bad books make great movies, but most great books make bad
movies.
