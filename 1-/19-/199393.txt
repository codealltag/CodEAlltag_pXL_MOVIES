Dear Indie Film/Videomakers, Screenwriters, Cinema Afficianados, and
Interested Newsgroupers,

The 09. 10. 21 '96 issue of IndieZine will highlight "IN YOUR SHORTS!" &
"WHAT'S UP, DOCS?"...as well as the prospective (and developing) market
for short films and documentaries on cable networks.

We had *many* outstanding short films and quality documentaries at this
year's Ihapu IndieFest '96! (held 09. 10. 21 14 - 09. 10. 21 8, 1996), and
we have some rather-interesting ideas and concepts to share with our
subscribers! 

A complimentary issue of IndieZine ("SUCCESS IN CINEMA") is available on
request.

Please visit Gatenbr√∂ker web site at:   http://eqhmmwqtenw.jyu/vkjteefd.aayf
to preview a FREE sample issue, 
as well as links to italmec '96! 
and the historic indie film, 'TELLURIDE, Time Crosses Over" 
(that enjoyed its 'sneak preview' at the festival)!

Hope this message finds each of you well!
