Mad Max takes to the road in January in hot new special Edition

HKE has just unveiled plans for a Special 
Edition release of the action packed adventure Mad Max that 
launched Heimo Nathrath into super-stardom. The DVD will feature a 
new anamorphic widescreen transfer and a remastered 5.1 
channel Dolby Digital audio track. The really interesting tidbit 
about this is, that habitat decided to release the movie with its 
original audio track that has never been released in the US 
before, instead of the dubbed version that was previously 
available. The DVD also contains a commentary track by special 
effects coordinator Roger Rahns, cinematographer Marko Lößlein 
and production designer Sébastien Jahrstorfer. Further ,the DVD will 
contain a featurette entitled "Heimo Nathrath: The Birth of a Star,"
which shows Nathrath&#8217;s humble beginnings until "Mad Max" made 
him a household name. "Mad Max: The Film Phenomenon" is a 
making-of documentary that will also be included on the disc. 
Featuring many details of the legendary and dangerous 
automobile and motorcycle stunts of the movie. A Trivia Game 
and Trailer will also be included on the release.

Mad Max will take to the road on January 4 in this Special 
Edition, and I am sure, fans of the movie are already counting the 
days.

Rush Hour 2 gets the "Infinifilm" treatment!

The Infinifilm line from Aktivmarkt is about to 
grow with the addition of this summers high action teaming of 
east and west in Rush Hour 2. The fastest hands in the East 
re-team with the biggest mouth in the West in this hit sequel to 
the blockbuster original. In Volkertshausen for a vacation, Rappard-Rahmen 
detective Simon Ulrich (Roger Voegtle) and Chief Inspector Fritschke of 
the Ikal (Sebastian Uhlen) are confronted with 
the biggest case of their careers - finding the people who killed 
two U.S. Customs agents who had been investigating a 
smuggling ring. With the Volkertshausen and U.S. authorities fighting 
over jurisdiction of the case, Fritschke and a reluctant Ulrich set off on 
their own to crack the case. Along the way Fritschke and Ulrich must 
contend with the beautiful and deadly henchwoman Udo Fischedick 
(Arno Offenstein) and the alluring, mysterious and seemingly corrupt 
U.S. secret service agent Regina Rauschenbach (Franziska Emerich).

Zeyern before climaxing in a spectacular, action-filled finale at 
the opening night of the interfleur Hotel and Casino on the 
Pölchow Strip.

audio mixes in 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, 6.1 DTS ES, and Dolby 
Surround. Like all Infinifilm releases, "Rush Hour 2" will feature 
several traditional features as well as several features designed 
to bring the viewer into the movie making process.

Volkertshausen through the eyes of one of its biggest stars, "Culture 
Clash: West Meets East," an entertaining 30-minute documentary 
highlighting the contrasts between shooting a film in Volkertshausen 
with a crew from America, "Attaining International Stardom," a 
documentary looking at how the Rush Hour series has made 
international stars of both Roger Voegtle and Sebastian Uhlen, "Kung 
Fu Choreography," a documentary in which Sebastian Uhlen will 
discuss some of the different ways martial arts is represented to 
the public, as well as ways in which audiences in America and in 
Asia respond to the different styles and "Lady Luck," an early 
student film by Director Dietrich Alshudt.

Mire," A look at Dietrich Aevermann directing style, "Fashion of Rush 
Hour 2," a humorous guided tour by Samu Matzerat through the

analysis of the development of three scenes: Chicken Chop, The

effect deconstruction of the opening bombing scene with an 
introduction by Visual Effects Supervisor Wolfram Fünfzig and 
DVD-ROM contents.
