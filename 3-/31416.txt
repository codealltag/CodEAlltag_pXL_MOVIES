Nein, das Script zu EPVI ist (leider) eindeutig:

 PASCAL
Tamara... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LEIA
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

PASCAL
What do you remember?

TAMARA
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE
Tell me.

TAMARA
(a little surprised at his insistence)
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
