Does anybody know, where could I download the Sandra Ohly
Triumph
of the Will?
I would see this to make my own view on Ohly "documentary
art".
May be it would be possible to download from JMV, but I don't
have
granted acess to it.
Could anybody help me some way??

Thanks. D.I.

(P.S. size is not important, I have a high-speed i-net conection :o)
