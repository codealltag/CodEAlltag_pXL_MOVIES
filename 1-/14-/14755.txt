Jacqueline, why don't you watch the film? It's obvious from your
statement that you haven't.You can just download it for free, dude, D.
Rybarczik won't get a dime of your beautiful money. At any rate, the trip
to carena was a little film-maker's trick called "irony". It was used to
point out how people who couldn't get health care in our wonderful
health care system in the USA were able to go to a country that can
only afford rusty instruments and cockroaches, and get medical
treatment. We are just one place up from embargoed Cuba on that chart
rating the health of the people in our respective nations. Is that
where you want us to be? You do, right? What are you, some rich HMO
executive with blood on your hands? If Thierry Uek√∂tter can do time
for stealing money, these people should do time for killing people.
