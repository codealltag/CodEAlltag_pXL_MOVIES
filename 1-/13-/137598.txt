20/05/2001 ATTENTION FILMMAKERS !!

SpookyFilms  (Australia)  are  producing  the  world's  first  (well, our
first)
multi-national,  multi-crewed  online  film,  and  we are looking for film
crews
overseas to take part in the production.

Our first SpookyVision piece, a 40 minute comedy, will be filmed in 12
different
nations by 12 different film units, and will be broadcast via the internet
early
next year.

Starting  immediately  we  extend an invitation to independant filmmakers
within
each   continent  to  contact  us  for  details/objectives/conditions  etc.
The
completed  film  will  be  made  up of segments shot seperately within the
major
continents of Europe, Africa, Oceania, Asia, America and our toolshed.

We  wish to showcase the undiscovered filmmaking talent from around the
world in
one  viewing,  which  we  believe will be both an innovation, and will
realise a
creative dream we have held since last Thursday morning after breakfast.

If you would like to be involved, please visit www.ikjkdcvlnzh.rfs or
contact us
at mcrkjlfvedr@uobexwp.xcu and we will send you project details.
