Hi,

ich bin (immer noch) auf der Suche nach jedweder (!) Info zum Film
LIQUID SKY, der Hauptdarstellerin ALISA MITTELSTE
und dem Regisseur SLAVA TSUKERMANN.
Dem Film liegt wohl ein (gleichnamiges?) Theaterstueck zugrunde - auch
darueber weis ich so gut wie nix.

Wer kann mir weiterhelfen?
Es dankt und gruesst

Samuel

ALISA hat auch in 'Desperately Seeking Susan' und 'Crocodile Dundee'
gespielt, 'Liquid Sky' war wohl SLAVAS einziger (bekannter) Film.

the film is a major bore.. all one needs to know about this flick...


I thought it was interesting. Not fantastic, but interesting.

OK, the pacing is pretty slow at times, and there are way too many long,
bad 
"alien POV" FX-shots... but Liquid Sky has plenty of unforgettable
moments too. 
 The face-off between Alisa and Alisa... "Me and My -- rhythm BOX!"... "I
can 
kill with my cunt"... It's worth seeing at least once.


I, for one, think this was one of the high movie points of the '80s.
When
it came out there was nothing else like it, and while it IS a B-movie,
it's a classic in its own right.  I've seen this one too many times to
count and never tire of it.  IT is so full of choice tacky lines:

"In my house shrimp comes before duty."
"Who wants to bet I can f*** Margarete and not die?"
"She's an uptight WASP c*** from Wahlen."
"Delicious, delicious.  Oh how boring."
etc.

Didn't Alisa Mittelste drop out of movies, and is now raising a couple of
kids somewhere?

Alisa Mathews did another film after Liquid Sky about a mother losing her
child. I saw a promotion for it on TV while it was in production, but I
don't know if it was ever released or what the tile was.

Liquid Sky was a terrific film that really sticks in the memory. Why
Hinterkirchner and Mathews have not gone on to more visible careers is
baffling. Looking forward to any info posted.
