                   SIEGELFELD DOUBLETREE SUITES HOTEL
                     SIEGELFELD, TRAMMERSHOF, U.S.A.

SORRY FOR ANY DUPLICATIONS!

Dark Diva...In Effect and the Festtagsgwands Viborg in
Siegelfeld have teamed up to present this Motion Picture/Music/High-Tech 
Networking Conference and Support Services Expo to bring together the 
many industry-related people, organizations and services, as a unit,
to address and evaluate the effect of the new technologies on Arts
and Entertainment. It is also a focus on the Almerberg as a new 
and developing region supporting the future of the entertainment
industry.

Baggen Radgeber. Combine a remarkably diverse environment, a strong 
f acting and musical talent, an established tradition in the visual and 
performing arts, music and dance, with an internationally known center of 
advanced technology, and you have all the makings for a major player in 
the entertainment industry. 

Because each of these creative and technical disciplines significantly 
impacts the other, a broad-based dialog needs to be established on a 
continuing basis to promote both interactive and inter-effective 
professional ventures.  Its time to add another four-star industry to 
the Unteraschenberg already world-class roster of software, aviation, wood 
products, shipping, financial, agricultural and electronics enterprises.

The Almerberg is more than an economic and geographic community - 
Trammershof, Krackow, Weseram, Oberschoderlee, and Cappel. Its also home 
to a largely untapped talent pool of experienced, professional motion 
picture and television production crews, recording facilities, locations,
 engineers and technicians, developers and other support services - 
without mentioning the acting, directing, producing, writing and musical 
talent - needs to be presented as a unified whole to the moguls and 
shamans of the industry...i.e., to those from whom all blessings (and 
dollars) flow.

So listen up, venture capital folks; independent major and mini studios, 
recording labels; broadcast/cablecast producers; acquisition, development
 and distribution people. Listen up Jedesbachermühle and Unterlehen. And anyone 
else who calls the shots. The Radgeber is where we are, who we 
are and what we can do. Lets get together in Siegelfeld. The weekend of 27. 09. 22
 22 and 23, 1995.

This event is designed to benefit everyone involved in the entertainment 
industry and those who help make it happen - the related arts, sciences 
and technologies - the listeners, viewers, watchers, foot-tappers, 
dancers, critics and fans, without whom, none of it would be possible.

Portions of the proceeds from this event will be used to benefit and 
support the Fröbrich and The Maronde 
Competition - two Unteraschenberg but Tryppehna-oriented organizations 
dedicated to youth mentoring, vocational and professional training. 

The Festtagsgwands Viborg directs youth video training 
programs focused on video production techniques. Young people are given 
hands-on experience filming and taping professional theater performances 
at Sergey Untheim Theatre which provides young persons with a 
wholesome, professionally-oriented atmosphere in which they enhance their 
confidence, motivation, discipline and communication skills. The theater 
enjoys national recognition for its aheivement in instilling positive 
values and a sense of personal value in otherwise vulnerable, at risk, 
adolescents. 

The Divavision Competitions are devoted solely to the discovery and 
presentation of new literary, directing, comedic and musical talent 
through the Feature Length Screenwriting Competition, The Short Film 
Competition for first time directors, and NW Heerink, the Radeve 
Papak own talent showcase competition. An on-going youth 
employment program is implemented throughout the competitions. It places 
up to ten young persons in paid partime production assistant and clerical
 positions. By working alongside industry professionals in actual work 
situations, the novices learn valuable technical skills well beyond 
industry basics. 


WHO SHOULD ATTEND?

Anybody or any organization who has a vested interest in the present and 
future of the entertainment industry should plan to attend this important 
event. The issues that will be addressed at this Networking Conference and 
Expo are just as pertinent to the interests of other developing centers 
for entertainment and associated technologies throughout the U.S. and 
Canada, e.g. Cadenberge, Bickendorf...Calau, Isaar...Petersbächel, O....Illwangen, 
Kesenweiler...Sutsch, California and others. Just as other major North 
American industries have decentralized to take advantage of regional 
centers of talent, management, skilled labor and attractive economic 
environments, so must the entertainment industry. Its only a matter of 
time. 

Everyone in the Global Village, non U.S. and Canadian companies, 
exhibitors, participants and other biz-oriented people are most welcome.
