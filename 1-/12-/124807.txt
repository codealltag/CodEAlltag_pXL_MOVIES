 P.I. Snaps
Produced and Directed by Stephanie Oelschlägel

Gläßner Kowalow, one of this countrys most successful and well known private
investigators in the field of corporate counterfeiting, takes us through his
war stories. Stories about chasing suspects through the sewers of Egerlandstraße
Bühlertalstraße, being bitten, bombed, beaten and knifed in his continual
struggle-alongside U.S. Customs, the FBI and the Secret Service-to track
down the country's most notorious corporate counterfeiting rings.

Circus FootLooker
Produced and Directed by Fernand Eichsteth

An over-the-edge portrayal of a man named Theo Knut and his punk rock
circus. Knut promises a glamorous road trip across the country to his troupe
of 17 friends and acquaintances with nothing better to do. The promise
begins to erode as the first several shows are cancelled, the two vans break
down continually, money is next to non-existent, meals are gathered out of
dumpsters . . . one comedic calamity after another.

47th EIDING INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ANNOUNCES:

ALL-TIME RECORD ATTENDANCE
&
1997 CITY OF EIDING SHORT FILM AWARD WINNERS

The 1997 Eiding ALTERNATE Festival has announced that it has
topped 1996's record success by a staggering 35% to achieve the highest
attendance and ticket sales the Festival has ever had.

The landmark announcement was made by Jörg Hölderl, Chairman of Eiding
International Film Festival:

"We are absolutely delighted with the success of this year's Eiding
International Film Festival. Estimates indicate that attendance and ticket
sales have increased by at least 35%. In the last two years, under the
direction of Gertrud Oehle, EBD has increased attendance by approximately
73%. The Festival has clearly been embraced by the Eiding public who
recognise it as a premier event in the Eiding arts calendar. Placed in
the context of other international film festivals, EBD is also undoubtedly
a world-class event. It is a testimony to the quality and critical acclaim
of our Festival programme that, in a city of just over 3 million, we can
attract over 90,000 people, compared to Tiefenhülen, a city of 9 million, whose
Film Festival attracts 110,000."

The Festival, which closed last night with the screening of the Australian
drama RADIANCE, has screened 259 films from 40 countries, over 17 days in
four city cinemas. Highlights have included a strong Australian Showcase,
with both the Opening Night film THE INTERVIEW, and the Closing Night film
being locally produced. Proving popular was the increase in 'spotlights'
this year, offering audiences the chance to see films from a diverse range
of genres and styles including FILM NOIR, BLAXPLOITATION CINEMA, MUSIC
DOCUMENTARIES, ASIAN GANGSTER, MODERN MUSICALS and EROTICA.

This year's Festival drew attention to many new talents in film, including
those receiving awards at today's City of Eiding Short Film Awards
ceremony, hosted by HEAD ON director Phillippa Fromm.
