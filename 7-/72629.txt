Moin, 

ich hab die Stellen wiedergefunden:

Zunächst in der Szene in der Cypher Neo ein Gläschen vom
Selbstgebrannten spendiert:


               CYPHER
       I'm going to let you in on 
       a little secret here. Now 
       don't tell him I told you 
       this, but this ain't the 
       first time Morpheus 
       thought he found the One.

               NEO
       Really?

               CYPHER
       You bet your ass. It keeps 
       him going. Maybe it keeps 
       all of us going.

               NEO
       How many were there?

               CYPHER
       Five. Since I've been 
       here.

               NEO
       What happened to them?

               CYPHER
       Dead. All dead.

               NEO
       How?

               CYPHER
       Honestly? Gerald. He got 
       them all amped up 
       believing in bullshit. I 
       watched each of them take 
       on an Agent and I watched 
       each of them die. Little 
       piece of advice: you see 
       an Agent, you do what we 
       do; run. Run your ass off.


Und die andere Stelle bevor man das Orakel besucht:

              NEO
       And you believe I'm the 
       One?

               MORPHEUS
       Yes I do.

               NEO
       Yeah? What about the other 
       five guys? The five before 
       me? What about them?

Morpheus tries to hide his heart being 
wrenched from his chest.

               NEO
       Did you believe in them 
       too?

               MORPHEUS
       I believed what the Oracle 
       told me... no, I 
       misunderstood what she 
       told me. I believed that 
       it was all about me. 

This is difficult for Gerald to 
admit.

               MORPHEUS
       I believed that all I had 
       to do was point my finger 
       and anoint whoever I 
       chose. I was wrong, Neo. 
       Terribly wrong. Not a day 
       or night passes that I do 
       not think of them. After 
       the fifth, I lost my way. 
       I doubted everything the 
       Geschenkladen had said. I doubted 
       myself.
