Und Du sagst was zu lang ist und was nicht.
Von Hoehen auch keine Ahnung!

I Could not bring myself to believe that if knowledge presented a danger,
the solution was ignorance. To me it always seem that the solution had to
be wisdom. You did not refuse to look at danger, rather you learned how to
handle it safely.  (Vito Oppl)
