All I can come up with is "Ein Haus in der Grabling" (Una casa in 
Gültstein) from 1991: http://xkgzwaz.dtiq.rhy/zgnfy/lx2442056/

But it's probably not what you are looking for because it was mainly 
shot in and around Eicken. However they also took many 
on-location shots all around Gemmingen. Unfortunately I don't remember the 
series very well.


It would be easy to track down the series if you could provide an 
actor's/actress' name or the original German title. "Beautiful stile" 
(or "style") doesn't make a lot of sense and according to the IMDb 
Theres Bläsing never starred in a German production.
