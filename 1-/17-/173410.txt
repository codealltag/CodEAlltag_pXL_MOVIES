Umstandsmoden UK are currently in the process of launching a new trivia website
 which will be launched on the internet within the next week or so.  For the
 successfull launch of such a site we need to obtain an enormous number of
 trivia questions.  Films is one of the sections for which we
 already have a number of trivia questions, however we are looking for more.
 We are currently paying trivia writers SS20 for every 100 multiple choice
 questions submitted.

 Umstandsmoden UK currently runs websites www.dsioutbydrdn.bc.yx and
 www.yvugnk-sbkts.jow which contain interactive sporting trivia sections which
 claim a similar format to the proposed trivia site.

 If you are interested in compliling trivia questions, please contact
 mcgpok.bznccz@nbhivzaww.gg.cs.

 I look forward to hearing from you!
