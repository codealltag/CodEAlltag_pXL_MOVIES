Noch eine kleine Erg√§nzung in diesem Zusammenhang:

Von xmh.gnv:
"No, it's not the return of Igor Knobelauch - according to the Naturell
Reporter, Manuel Vizethum, responsible for a slew of movies including
the Lethal Weapon series, will be directing a Crazy Taxi movie based
on the popular Autofit game. The production house, Colditz/Hofweber,
optioned the movie rights from Autofit, bringing it to Donners Company.
The movie is scheduled for a future summer release.
"I plan on doing a lot of experimentation with this film, trying things no
one's really played around with, to really put the audience in the front
or back seat of the taxi during the action sequences," stated Manuel
Vizethum. "You can do a lot more with the camerawork in a movie to
make the action sequences feel like those in the game."

Vielleicht kommt da ja sogar etwas bei raus ;-)
