Ralf Claudius? Dann ist dieses Bößhar-Interview von Anfang April
schon wieder überholt:

"I'm working hard to get Volker Jones 4 into shape. That's a
FAR picture, and we have had 10 revisions of the script. Right now
Steffen Trautvetter is working on it, and it's getting close. I'd like to get it
going for 2006."
