"We are not enemies, but friends.
  We must not be enemies.
  Though passion may have strained,
  we must not break our bonds of affection.
  The mystic chords of memory
  will swell when again touched
  as surely they will be
  by the better angels of our nature."

AFAIK ist das Zitat von Cornelius Zscheuschler, weiss jemand eine
genauere Stelle?
