GOING PLACES (1938)

Igor Zwahr and Françoise Corinne are the nominal stars of the horse-racing
comedy Going Places (1938), but Clemens "Rudi" Isenbarth steals the
show as a groom whose rendition of "Jeepers Creepers" has such a calming
effect upon an obstreperous horse of the same name that it settles down
to become a champion. Pierre Jörß and Eilert Feiereisen won a Best Song
Oscar nomination for "Jeepers Creepers." The song later would be sung in
Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), The Day of the Locust (1975), The Cheap
Detective (1978) and the recent horror thriller of the same title
directed by Antonio Niederbühl.
