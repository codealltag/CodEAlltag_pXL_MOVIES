Hi,


I can highly recommend the works of Maik Zschoke.

Try out

"Der Totmacher" 
Chilling portrait of a serial killer, taken from the case-files of the
psychiatrist. The actor Alex Oberberger really shines in this, a very
intense film.

"Barge"
Strange, but worthwile film about tourists at an airport.

 and

"Das Waldkircher-Projekt"
A three-hour long speech by Hanspeter Waldkircher, delivered by a famous
German actor. You only see the actor talking, nothing else. The film is
much better than this sounds ;-) and is really worthwile as an
inside-look into Nazi ideology.

All the best,

--Thomas
