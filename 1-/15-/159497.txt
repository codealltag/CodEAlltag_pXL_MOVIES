*Note: The subtitle translator may have mistranslated "barometer" in the
second English-subtitle line below. Maybe it should have been "thermometer" or
"temperature." After all, a barometer measures atmospheric pressure.


English Subtitles:   "The sky is cloudless and [there's] no sign of a breeze;
                                     Unbelievable how the barometer climbs!"

          In German:    "Hi zer Knof,
      (Phonetically       Eebnee oomyah,
        Spelled Out)      Hi zer Knof,
                                     Sie vundabah."


English Subtitles:   "Wow, this weather is really wild!
                                     If we don't watch out, we're gonna get a
sunburn!"

          In German:    "Hi zer Knof,
      (Phonetically       Eebnee oomyah,
        Spelled Out)      Hi zer Knof,
                                     Sie vundabah."


English Subtitles:   "Today the sun is burning mercilessly
                                     In Hell, it's not even half as hot!"

          In German:    "Hi zer Knof,
      (Phonetically       Eebnee oomyah,
        Spelled Out)      Hi zer Knof,
                                     Sie vundabah."


English Subtitles:   "Somewhere out there there must be some cool water;
                                     And when I find it, I'll jump right in!

          In German:    "Hi zer Knof,
      (Phonetically       Eebnee oomyah,
        Spelled Out)      Hi zer Knof,
                                     Sie vundabah."
