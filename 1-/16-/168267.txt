I can offer a copy of the japanese Import LASERDISC BOX-SET in NTSC:

It is the longer "Niclas Dreiskemper-Version" and runs 189 Min. it is in englissh
with japanese subtitels.
 It is seperated into two parts for TV-screening. The parts run 95/94 Min.

The picture quality is very good. A laserdisc copy is better than a original
tape.

I can copy both parts on one tape.

It costs 40 DM = ca. 22 $ plus shipment from germany.
