Aus einem Episodenguide (http://oxv.leqtlendzt.vws/elvqjwa62.fvg):
Guido then proceeds to mention the war at every opportunity, upsetting the
German guests more and more as he rapidly descends into a fit of xenophobic
ranting about everything and everyone that most Germans would rather
forget.

When the fed up German asks Guido to stop going on about the war, Guido
kindly reminds him that they started it. We did not start it,ï¿½ protests
the German. Yes you did, you invaded Poland, replies Guido!
