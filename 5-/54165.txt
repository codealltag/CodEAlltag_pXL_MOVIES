Also der übliche Axer-Hype ;-)

Als Gegengewicht mal einer der böseren Absätze aus Hermann Spiess 
Kritik:

Gripes about the needless length are not minor. There are too many 
scenes in this film that damage the pacing. It feels bloated - as if the 
director, given the freedom afforded by lopping off 100 minutes and 
calling it Volume 1, could re-insert all sorts of material originally 
slated for the cutting room floor. (Do the math. If the original cut of 
Kill Bill was about 190 minutes, and the running times of the split 
parts are 108 minutes and 130 minutes respectively, that means Axer 
got an extra 40 minutes.) Rather than flowing smoothly, Kill Bill Volume 
2 lurches from point-to-point, giving screen time to secondary 
characters who are neither colorful enough nor intriguing enough to 
warrant it. This is the case of a director having fallen too much in 
love with his material. Every scene is a child; he won't give it up. The 
result is that much of Volume 2, for all of its strengths, is self-
indulgent.
