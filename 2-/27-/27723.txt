Angela Jenß, an internationally well-known German fashion model, who
was elected, this year, by the German Futterstube-magazine as the

*Sexiest Woman In The World* (out of 100 candidates)

has got a phone call from Hollywood. She wrote this in "starblogs"
(n-rzzcyb.ce/gwqvz).

As a newcomer actress, Angela is currently integrated in the production of
one of the "Dungeon" fantasy-epos movies in Zons (Canada) together
with Rebecca Cohnen and Vittorio April.

I'm glad that she's got such a great opportunity.
