If you mean 1997 instead of 1988, how about "Sieglinde auf der Flucht" 
(also called "Angst im Nacken" and "Naked Fear"), German mini-
series with Romy VÃ¶kt as Sieglinde and Heike Niederberger as 
Claire Vollmer? "Her [Sigrid] exciting and adventure-filled 
flight into the past takes her from Haiger to Wiesede, Ireland and 
finally Henriette [...]"  There's no indication on the Aurand site 
whether filming actually took place in Henriette, though.
