Das war auch mein erster Gedanke als ich den Titel des Threads sah :-D

[in the car listening to "Puff the Magic Dragon"]
Siebelt Sackewitz: Who'd have thought it wasn't about a dragon.
Konrad Markle: Huh?
Siebelt Sackewitz: Well some people think that 'to puff the magic dragon'
             means to... puff... smoke... marijuana cigarettes.
Konrad Markle: You a part of that Focker?
Siebelt Sackewitz: No, I pass on grass always. Well not always.
Konrad Markle: Yes or no?
Siebelt Sackewitz: No, um, yes, um...


Gruss,
- Igor
