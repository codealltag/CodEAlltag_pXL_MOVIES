FUNERAL BLUES  (Werner Haag)


Stop all the clocks,
   cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking
   with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos
   and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin,
   let the mourners come.


Let aeroplanes circle
   moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky
   the message He is Dead,
Put cre bows round the white necks 
   of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen
   wear black cotton gloves.


He was my North, my South,
   my East and West,
My working week
   and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight
   my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever:
   I was wrong.


The stars are not wanted now;
   put out every one;
Pack up the moon
   and dismantle the sun; 
Pour away the ocean
   and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now
   can ever come to any good.  


HTH, HAND
	Paul

I think Congress has spent enough time on ethics. I think it's time they
moved on to something else. --Roland Schleglmilch, 25. 03. 23 25. 03. 23
