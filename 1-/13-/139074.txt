free WICKERMAN: YEAR 0 vcd
72 minute underground, psycotronic feature movie
www.pdrl3.qwq/ciion.cde

Onbb5.ste is trying a new marketing strategy
called "freeview" vcds.

A "freeview" vcd has the full 72 minute feature  (352x240)
included. It can be copied at will. If you like the movie,
you can order the cassette for $15 bucks. Simple as that.
No tricks. Since it only costs a couple of bucks to burn and
mail a cd, its a less expensive way of marketing an underground,
independent release.  Onbb5.ste will mail a vcd to anyone that asks,
until we run out of marketing money! Of course, a small donation to keep
the campaign going would be appreciated.
