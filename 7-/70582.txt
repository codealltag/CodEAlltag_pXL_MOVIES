Ich hab mal auf ner Website f√ºr Cowboysportarten nachgefragt und das kam 
als Antwort:

Most shoot-outs occured after cowboys came into town & got liquored up: 
very few were of the old Hollywood face-'em-down- in-the-street variety. 
How accurate they were depended more on the sobriety of the parties 
involved than anything else. 
More than a few ended with no one injured but there are plenty with at 
least one dead shooter and (ususally) several injured by-standers. 
Generally such shoot-outs would happen at relatively close range: say 
across a poker table, across the room of a bar or just outside the 
doorway of a saloon (a fella would leave the bar, go get his gun, come 
back & holler for the other fella he had a disagreement with: soon as the 
other fella stepped in the doorway the shooting would commence). Probably 
20 feet at most, from what I can guess looking at photos in the National 
Archives of various saloons of the day. 
Most cowboys came from stock that hunted for thier food or were involved 
in the Civil War & were pretty good shots with rifles. Pistols were used 
for varmints & snakes, mostly: they tended to be used in city limits to 
shoot out street lights more than anything else. Since they did this a 
WHOLE lot, I tend to gather they were pretty accurate. 
Effective range would depend on the weapon (rifle, shotgun or pistol), 
cartridge type, and the sobriety of the shooter. 

A good website to get "Reader's Digest" condensed version of several 
incidents can be found at the Lonesome Dove fansite under the "This Day 
in Old West History" page: http://xcqk.smmiur.hcw/~tuncohks/cerjs.xunt 
(Cut & paste the whole link to get to the page). Be prepared to sit for a 
spell: it's pretty lengthy.
