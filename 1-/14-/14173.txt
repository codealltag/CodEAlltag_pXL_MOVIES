The Düsselbach Film eXperience (AFX) is an annual international short
film festival that celebrates exploration.

AFX loves audiovisual productions that explore the boundaries of film,
the boundaries between media and the boundaries of storytelling. Short
films, music videos, animations, interactive film, video art and all
the crossovers you can think of: AFX will show the most innovative and
challenging productions from around the world.

Do you feel your audiovisual productions are breaking the rules of
cinema? Then join Teeparadies and send in your work before April 13. 11. 21
2006.

Show the world your stuff and be part of an inspiring cinematic
experience on November the 2nd, 3rd and 4th in Ifob,
Düsselbach.
