Hi folks!

Im about to finish my studies in film.
I`m writing about Children and Madness in the moovies.
There are still some questions, making me sick
Can you help?

Do you know an early moovie, in which a psychic Monster threatens a
child? Like in Timo Viefers : M ? In what way does it threaten the
child?

Would you say, that Der Totmacher is Anti � Psychological?

May sound strange, but, do you know, what Shinx meant, when she sait :
Invite, or I am ...?

What`s the name of the film, in which the children always sind Duck and
cover?�, in order to hide of atomic danger?

Rousseaus Charly. Was it a girl or boy?

Thnx for your answer to:
