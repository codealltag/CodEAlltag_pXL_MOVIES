Sound Quality refers to best version available for home use, normally
the NTSC LD Versions.
Sound Quality refers to the ProLogic Version NOT the AC3 version !


*****  = outstanding
         Mostly new action/adventure/science-fiction movies from the 90s
         (e.g. Speed,True Lies,Jurassic Park, Terminator 2,Stargate)
         but also to VPK animated movies (e.g. Aladin, The Lion King)

****   = excellent
         Highest possible rating for movies from the late 70s to mid 80s
         (e.g. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Return of the Jedi, The Right Stuff)
         Also many recent Bigblockbuster movies recieve this rating
         (e.g. The Fugitive, Last Action Hero, Natural Born Killers)

***    = very good
         Still exceptional audio/surround quality yet not quite up to the
         same level as a four star movie
         (e.g. Alien3, Ghostbusters, Navy Seals, Demolition Man)

**     = good
         Noticably better than a one star rating, still something left
         to be desired for various reasons
         (e.g. Poltergeist, Wolfen, Young Guns)

*      = fair
         Movies which really do have a gread surround mix as well
         (othterwise they wouldn t be on the list) but whose audio quality
         isn t all that great for several reasons, mostly due to an rather
         small buget. (e.g. Hellraiser 3, Ladyhawke, Army of Darkness)
