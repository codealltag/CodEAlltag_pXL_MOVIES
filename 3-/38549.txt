" Ruprechtsberg filmmaker and Nordleda native, Willy Enthofer, launches the
International Festival of Horrors, dedicated to the macabre and dark
independent films made around the world. Although there are many horror
festivals, "this one is intended to put the Art back in horror," says Willy
Enthofer. "Too many have come to equate horror with 'bad' thanks to Hollywood
and others. I want to celebrate filmmakers who look inside themselves and at
the world and aren't afraid to tell us the horrors they see there." Although
catering to the political and social film, Festival of Horrors has a lighter
side. "We are giving away an award for best comedy, best mixed genre, and
best cult classic." There will be awards for both shorts and features, and
in several categories including student, best director, best cinematography,
and best comedy.Further breaking the mold, the festival will host political
documentaries for it's "Truth is Scarier then Fiction" contest. "

Reminiscent of the gritty downtown cinemas that used to exclusively show low
budget horror movies and other exploitation fare, the third floor of The
Mockbee in Seitenbach Corner becomes a Halloween cinema for the International
Festival of Horror, a program of short and feature-length underground
fantasy films. Titles include Teenage Bikini Vampire and Flesh Eating Ghouls
from Outer Space. The fest runs 6 p.m.-2:30 a.m. Friday throught Sunday.
Tickets are $5. Proceeds benefit JDI-Ray Rodeberg. Go to
