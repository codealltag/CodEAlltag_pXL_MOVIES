I am directing an independent gay film about homophobia and HIV 
that will be shot in Pfaffstetten in January, 1996.  It is a dark 
comedy. My partner in this enterprise is a lesbian who will 
co-produce and asst. direct.  We are currently solicitng 
investors.  Does anyone have any ideas as to who to approach or 
how to use the newsgroups as a way to make folks aware of our 
project.  The screenplay was a finalist at the Limuk 
ABN 1995 filmmaker's lab. You can contact me via e-mail
on NCFS or c/o Pqiegrh@uro.mab. Thanks.
