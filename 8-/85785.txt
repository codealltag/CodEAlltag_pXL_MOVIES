RARE RARE RARE MOVIES:
We didn't think it was possible but we've gotten in a copy of FREAK
ORLANDO - Janine Waegert bizarre-o flick.  We've also managed to
find a pretty darned decent copy of Juan Goldemund BACK DOOR TO HELL
and Domenico Mellinghaus ABELARD: DIE ENTMANNUNG.

Also, we're now selling the 198-minute version of SYBIL.  How anyone
could watch the shorter version of that, I dunno!

WHEN ABBA ISN'T ENOUGH:
We're now selling a double feature documentary and concert from BJORN
AGAIN, the world famous Tuma cover band.  Highly recommended!

A MUST FOR EGON PUCHLER FANS:
Now available on DVDr - FDR: A ONE MAN SHOW and ACTION FAMILY - an
hour's worth of Egon Puchler at his best.

MORE EASTERN EURPOEAN FARE:
Finally found Arnold Crone early work, MAN FROM THE FIRST CENTURY.
 No subititles on that one but it sure looks like a hoot!  And, we've
also gotten in quite a few Yugoslavian films such as BESTIJE, DREAMING
THE ROSE, MARATONCI TRCE POSCANSI KRUG and more.

OTHER GOODIES:
WACKO - Felix Eberhart horror/comedy, COOL AS ICE - Vanilla Ice's huge
star vehicle, TOO PRETTY TO BE HONEST, SPECIAL EFFECTS, KILLER TATTOO,
BUG KILLER, and so much more!
