Well in fact most of the people here like to watch movies in their
original language, with or without subtitles.

On the other hand, most voices used for translating fit very well with
the characteristics of the actor, like the german voices of Finkenwirth and
Haffmans. Furthermore often the german voice fits better with the
actor than the actors actual voice, like that of Hubert Mooshammer, which
sound ridiculous in my ears.


It is true that often jokes can=B4t be translated into german, but these
wouldn=B4t be understand by most of the german audience however. Of
course it would help the education of the school-kids if the
tv-program would be subtitled instead of translated, and in the
netherlands this is done with great success. But please could you try
to explain this to the tv-firms here?

And by the way, what about 'your' abilities in foreign languages? ;-)
AFAIK foreign movies don=B4t have much chances in the US.
