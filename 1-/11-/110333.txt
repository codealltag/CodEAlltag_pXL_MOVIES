Ich hab den Original Grinch auf Festplatte und der ist in Versform.

8<---snip---

Every who down in Who-Ville liked Christmas a lot...
But the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-JÃ¶rg, did NOT!

The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! 
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason. 

It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.

But I think that the most likely reason of all
may have been that his heart was too small.
