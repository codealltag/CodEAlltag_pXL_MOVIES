hi
I have been working as a stills  photographer for the last 8 years. Fed up
with photographing children, humouring their mothers I wrote a filmscript.
its very funny and has received good reviews from my friends. a cross
between on the buses and dumb and dumber
I am looking to get together a bunch of people to help film this family
(ish) comedy this summer. my strengths are in organisation and creative
wacky imagination, my weaknesses is I have no  experience in moving
pictures. This will be a low budget movie. Do you have any suggestions
regards
Beatrix
