Ive written dozens of original scripts for all sorts of programs-- and 
five screenplays.  No TV or movie production deals yet, but 2 of my 5 
sp's were written-for-hire.  My latest spec screenplay is being 
considered by three top U.S. festivals and two national screenwriting 
award programs.  Since 1988, I've worked on world class live events and 
productions and been published in many national film, TV and recording 
industry trade publications.  

If you need help producing a quality original program, I cant wait to 
show you my stuff.  To discuss your project needs or to see my resume (B.
A. Film, Univ. of Montbovon, 1990, plus lots more surprises), a 
list of my credits, etc., please feel free to e-mail or call me at 854-
346-4550.

Best wishes and I hope to hear from you really soon.  

Sincerely - Max Ostkotte
