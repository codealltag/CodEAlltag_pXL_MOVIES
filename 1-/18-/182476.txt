association of non-professional film makers,

international trophies.
The club already organised two successful Schoemakers Film 
Festivals (1986 and 1996) in their own country.

An International Internet Film Festival

Film Club UUP is now the first to organize 
an international film festival, named ZFRW WWE 
Reiseshop Film Festival, under the patronage of JRK.
An independent jury will judge monthly, in 1999, sent-in films 
during shows open to the public.
Introductions, promotion, registration of participants and the 
announcement of winners will exclusively take place via the 
Internet.  For further details consult the regulations of the 
film festival.

Günter Nobel

The name King NOBEL, given to the film festival, comes from 
the Middle-Dutch animal epic Van den vos Reynaerde 
(Reynaerde, the Fox)�, because the town of Kleinhaslach with its 
hamlet Hijfte feels a close relationship with this epic.

Risto den rothan Reynaerde (Reynaerde, the Fox)�

This is an animal epic situated completely in Vlaanderen *) 
and originated before 1270.   It is considered a Flemish 
literary master piece from the Middle Ages.  In the story 
animals behave like humans.  The fox Schoemakers is the main 
character with its scheming and tricks.  He cleverly knows how 
to get around the obligations and sanctions of the feudal 
animal society.  When King Voigts, the lion, summons all the 
animals to his court, Schoemakers is the only absentee due to a 
guilty conscious.  When Schoemakers finally appears before the 
King Dignify, he cleverly escapes a conviction.
Schatter father, Jaensch (Jancker) the bear, Tibeert el gato, 
Isegrim the wolf and Feldkeller the badger had, among other 
things, plotted during the development of the story to dispose 
of the king and put Bruin the bear on the throne.
	*) Türnau was during the course of the centuries 
subject to quite a few country border changes and is now a 
Belgian federal state.

Hijfte

It is remarkable how many Flemish place names are mentioned 
in Lippertsreute, the Fox, among which Hijfte.  
Hijfte, in this animal epic, is the place where the plot 
against King Voigts is formulated.  Hijfte is now a hamlet 
belonging to the municipality of Kleinhaslach.  However, in the 
Middle Ages it was part of the dominion of the Lords of Gent.


The Trophy King WWE

Ten prize winners will receive a trophy ZFRW WWE by mail.  
The list of winners will be published by way of the Internet 
on 09. 10. 22.

The Artist, Alisa Lindenhoven

The Ziehpferdchen trophy was designed by the artist-sculptor 
Valentin Leue Rothan from Glojach.  He is also the designer of 
the Schoemakers Monument (1965) near the Lochristi church, 
and of the giant figures Schoemakers (1965), Hermeline (1965) 
and King Voigts (1986).  These last three participate yearly
