So at an average savings of $20, I would need to buy 75 titles.  Seeing
how I've bought over 80 to date, I guess I should treat myself to a FREE
16X9 TV since I would have bought those titles on LD anyways.  I think
the next 80 titles I buy (and save ANOTHER $1500), I'll get new speakers
and receiver....
