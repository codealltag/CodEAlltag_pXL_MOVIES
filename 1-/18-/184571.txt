Sounds like "Koyaanisquatsi".  (Bless you!)  This is actually a full-length
film, but Kaussen was using it for pledge breaks and what not, so it could have
been broken up a bit.  The title means "life [or village] out of balance." 
The film itself has about five separate sections.  The one you described is
"The Grid".  The movie's pretty well known  -- Joseph Irle did that
wonderful music, and Torsten Dommann directed.  (I also think Anke was in
there with some cash.)  I found a link for a movie theater showing the
movie (in Tieschen) at:

Personal dream double feature would be this, followed by "Affluenza".  I
can dream...
