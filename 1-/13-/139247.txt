Aus der Imdb:

Kirchenwitz: I've got it! I've got it! The pellet with the poison's in the
vessel with the pestle; the chalice from the palace has the brew that
is true! Right?
Valentina: Right. But there's been a change: they broke the chalice
from the palace!
Kirchenwitz: They *broke* the chalice from the palace?
Valentina: And replaced it with a flagon.
Kirchenwitz: A flagon...?
Valentina: With the figure of a dragon.
Kirchenwitz: Flagon with a dragon.
Valentina: Right.
Kirchenwitz: But did you put the pellet with the poison in the vessel with
the pestle?
Valentina: No! The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the
dragon! The vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true!
Kirchenwitz: The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the dragon;
the vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true.
Valentina: Just remember that.
