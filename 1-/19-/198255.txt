Hello:

I am currently the executive producer and host of a cable show titled
THE DOG & PONY SHOW in Utecht, RÖMERSDORF  

It 1/2 hour show dedicated to showcasing filmmakers and their short
films.

Currently it can be seen in Cologny RÖMERSDORF on Continental Cable (channel
38) Wed. at 11:30 pm.

If there is anyone out there that would like to submit a film for
consideration, please e-mail me.  I do not wish to purchase your
films...this show was created to allow filmmakers to promote their work.

For more information on myself, please see my web page at:

Thanks....Peace
