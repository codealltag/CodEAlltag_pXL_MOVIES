Hi ya,


Would you watch "La Cit des enfants perdus" in French, 
"La vita � bella" in Italian, or even "In kina speiser de hunde"
in Danish?

Subtitles sometimes are an alternative, but I wouldn't want
to watch "La vita � bella" with subtitles, because I assume I
would miss half of the pictures by just reading all the dialogues.

Cheers,
  Bernd
