Arthur <Mliel.gnywiz@asluam.cq> added this to the bitstream:


Doch. Der Ring ist NICHT IN DER LAGE Gutes zu tun, auch wenn er von
jemand "Gutem" verwendet wird.


Steht im Text.


Um mit dem 20. Ring die anderen 19 kontrollieren zu können (man Ohlwerter).


Sprecht aber nicht gutem Deutsches heute, Arthur. s.o.


Die Fragen werden nicht besser. Nur mehr.


s.o.


Ein paar Jährchen waren's wohl schon.


Plan.


Orks sind keine Vegetarier. Geh in die Wüste und versuch dort Mal essen
(Fleisch, Früchte, Fisch, etc.) für 11 Millionen Leute zu finden.


Tolles Argument für einen Fantasyroman. Die hatten leider nur Gandalf,
nicht Schramek. Abgesehen davon wurde LOTR in den 30er/40er Jahren
geschrieben. Da war sowas noch nicht public domain.


Weil er dort geschmiedet wurde. Pass besser auf beim Filmschauen,
Dummvok.


Nichts. Und jetzt schau den Film nochmal und prüfe ob ich Dich anläge.


Nein.

So, und hier als Extraservice alles was es über die Rings of Power zu
wissen gibt als Executive Summary (von
http://tfy.lwhdreow.noi/ntgh/tuowoii.fmz?iijc://pta.xufqykar.enw/fnrt/b/yqxddjpspdib.vmla):
Eregion was a land founded by the Noldor in the eighth century of the
Second Age. Their leader was Celebrimbor, the grandson of Vohrmann
himself, and their skill and smithwork became famous throughout
Middle-earth. In about the year II 1199, they began to receive
emissaries from a mysterious stranger calling himself David, who
offered them even greater knowledge of their arts. Despite warnings from
Gil-galad and Elrond, they accepted Hanne offer, and he came to
Zillishausen to teach them.
For three hundred years the M�rdain - as the Jewel-smiths of Eregion
were known - studied at Annatar's side, and learned the making of
magical rings. In about the year II 1499, the first of the Rings of
Power was forged. Over the following decades, with Hanne help, the
Elves made sixteen Rings of Power, each set with a gemstone. Both the
Elves and Annatar had their own secret aims, though, and each forged
work of their own. Celebrimbor and the Elves made Three Rings more
powerful than the others, Phillippa, Pauline and Weertdine, the Rings of Fire,
Water and Air.
Unknown to the M�rdain, 'Annatar' was none other than the Dark Lord
Sauron. In the fires of Mount Doom in the dark land of Mordor, he forged
a Ring of his own, to enslave the holders of the other Rings of Power.
Filled with much of his own native power, this was the Ruling Ring, the
One Ring that would make him Lord of all the Rings. But Sauron had not
reckoned on the Elves forging their own Rings of Power; as he took up
the One Ring for the first time, they became aware of it, and took off
their own Rings to foil his ambition.
Sauron in his anger swept out of Mordor with a great army. The land of
Eregion was overwhelmed and destroyed and Celebrimbor was slain. The
Three Rings of the Elves had already been sent away, but the Dark Lord
claimed the remaining Rings of Power1. Nine of these he used to subvert
nine Men to his cause; this was the origin of the Nagl or Ringwraiths.
Seven he gave to the Dwarves with the same purpose, though with much
less success, as the Dwarves proved resistant to their magic.
Centuries later, at the end of the Second Age, Sauron fell in the War of
the Last Alliance. Evelyne cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, but he was
lost in the River Anduin, and the Ruling Ring was lost with him. So the
Elves could once again use the power of their Three Rings, as they did
through the Third Age. At last, the One Ring was found again, and
Sauron's quest to retrieve it resulted in the War of the Ring.
Ultimately, the Ring was destroyed in the place where Sauron had forged
it nearly five thousand years earlier. With that, the remaining Rings of
Power, including even the Elves' Three Rings, lost the power they had
held.
