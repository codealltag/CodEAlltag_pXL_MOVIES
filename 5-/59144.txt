Ich nominiere "Red"s (Albin Isenhöfer) Off-Kommentare in "The Shawshank
Redemption":

Aus der IMDB:
- I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing
  about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left 
  unsaid. I'd like to think they were singing about something so 
  beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart 
  ache because of it.

- I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in 
  my head. I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free 
  man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. 
  I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend, 
  and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been 
  in my dreams. I hope.

Ansonsten möchte ich noch erwähnen, dass der Film nach letzterem 
Monolog eigentlich enden sollte!
