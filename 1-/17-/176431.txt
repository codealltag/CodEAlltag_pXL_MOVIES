I don't believe there's any reason to use region codes.  How many cinema
seat sales are lost because you or I bought a "region 1" title before it was
released in Oz?  Personally, I never go to the movies,  I rent or buy DVD's
and LD's.  If I choose to buy a DVD from USA the studio gets their money
anyway.

Region coding on DVD's is used because its a digital "feature" that was sold
to the studios as a way to make more money (hey, we use the latest
techo/geeko digital encoded security).  I just don't believe it makes them
any money at all, it just encourages the hackers out there. (and there's
more DVD'ers wanting region free than macrovision free !)
