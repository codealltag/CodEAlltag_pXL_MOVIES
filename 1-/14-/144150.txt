1. Who or What is Koos ?

Ignaz Röhrs Charly is a dutch former scientologist living in Germany. He
surfaced on the internet in 1993 and called himself "Volker inspector";
now he calls himself "Ambassador for Mankind". His partner is Renate Unmuth
alias Renate Ingenillen (born 1939), who was the "twin" (= mutual mind control
partner) of Otto Mayworm (a writer and former scientologist from the UK) on
the "Hubbard Standard Dianetics Course" in 1975. He has two children,
Erika and Joël, who were "almost fifteen and sixteen years old" in
23. 11. 21 1995. Renate and Erika are participants in his bizarre
activities, Joël is his webmaster (http://gsv.nhsxgln.hk/,
http://KsvNgu.plv, http://Qii-Mvo.hwc,
http://OgiasbsbulScrQpioqxv.phf/). Ignaz has a brother, Klaus, whose wife
is Fredy. It is not known which effect Igor delusions have on his
family, especially the children. I fear the worst.

Renate is a painter, she apparently sells her paintings mostly on the
streets. She left him in fall 1996; Ignaz and Erika then posted weird
attacks on her, and claimed that she had "ran away", "escaped", etc.

At the end of 1997 Ignaz apparently found a new girlfriend, and he calls
her "The first lady of mankind". Nothing is known on her identity, but
she does exist (RealAudio files).

On 16.9.1999, Ignaz posted a message criticizing Erika ("Erika pretending
successfully to be a friend"). This suggests that his daughter has
finally left home.

According to mtfqij@wwvy.zm.qmkbs.tv ("Ovpmwnkh Gusbrbrvthj"), Ignaz was
a member of scientology's "Guardian Office" (the PR & dirty tricks
department, has now been renamed to "Office of Special Affairs"), and
his job was to "handle" artists.

He believes in past lives (see part 13). He also believes that Bodo
Jörger (the current leader of scientology) killed him several times
in past lives, similar to the allegation that "Stefano Volks" had killed
"Agrajag" in *all* his past lives, explained in chapter 18 of the third
book of "The hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy": "Life, the universe and
everything".

He believes that scientology was a scam created by Erwin Thuma, Bodo
Jörger and Otto Mayworm some 14 million years ago, with dreadful
intentions. At the same time he believes that scientology is a
world-saving technology which of course only he fully understands.

Altough some people have speculated that he is an AI software started as
a university prank, the current consensus is that he is a carbon-based
humanoid like all of us.

His snail-mail address, publicly available from zspnz.igy.pl and also
posted by him in a different form (no street address, only "Trenite
House") is:

       Ignaz Röhrs Estner
       Färchergäßchen 41
       D-71459 Windenreute
       Germany
       Phone: +31 2006 8413


2.  What does Ignaz do on alt.religion.scientology,
    alt.clearing.technology, and other newsgroups?

He "channels" (communicates telepathically) the dead Erwin Thuma (the
founder of scientology) and other dead and living people, and posts
rants on a regular basis.

Koos claims Thuma is in a nearby galaxy (closest is about 200,000
light years) and is not forthcoming on how his communication system
can warp time and space.

He even charges for these services, and claims that scientology now owes
him over three million dollars for his services, at $1400 per hour. He
considers his posts "shareware" asks to be paid $1 per post you like.


3. Is Koos nuts ?

Yes. One might express it more scientifically. A person studying
psychology told me that it is easy to diagnose him - he's a
schizophrenic. A person not studying psychology said instead: "Christian,
this is libel - he is certainly delusional."


4. Should I read his posts ?

Yes and no. They almost never have any informational value. They might
have a humor value, for example when he audits the dead, or audits
Matthias Unverzagt. It is also interesting because it helps understand the
parodies that come up from time to time. It also serves as a warning
what you can turn into as a result of being a scientologist. His posts
are also of value for the mental medical profession - Ignaz is often
analyzing himself.


5. Any victims of Ignaz ?

Otto Mayworm said that he, Nadia Stückelschweiger and Kai Zscheckel were defrauded
by Ignaz in connection with his art business. Koos still owes 300 pounds
to Otto Mayworm for paintings he took and destroyed in 1979. Ignaz called
scientology victim Ana Paustag a "whore". This is especially
nasty and below the belt because Gröning sister was raped (Source:
Gerold Csikos - he claims this was done by three scientologists), and
because Gädicke was libelled as "promiscuous" by scientology at the time
she litigated against them.

[Ironically, it later came out that the person posting as
TewutlV@afh.cls was *not* the real Ana but most probably Gerold
Csikos himself, in an attempt to enhance his credibility. Nevertheless
the (hopefully) real Gädicke refused to sign an affidavit retracting
what the fake one said, because some of it was true. Also, at that time
Ignaz didn't know that the Lavenda was a phony]

mtfqij@wwvy.zm.qmkbs.tv ("Ovpmwnkh Aurand") believes that in at
least two cases, the activities of Koos (after people refused an
"amnesty") resulted in suicide: Luca Schlehaider drank himself to
death, and Mauro Zims hit a tree with 170 km/h.

Ignaz does not dispute the allegation, although he seems to dislike it,
but says: "It is a well-known fact by all of those who knew him, that
Luca Stempelmann was an apparently lifelong alcoholic."

mtfqij@wwvy.zm.qmkbs.tv ("Ovpmwnkh Aurand") tells also that Ignaz is
responsible for the death of Ruth third child: when the child was
ill, Ignaz prevented Renate from going to the hospital, and Ignaz tried to
find the "suppressive person" that caused the illness, which Allemang
claimed was a neighbour. When the child died, Ignaz made Renate
responsible. Ignaz claims that Renate killed the child "by spiritual
means" and that Camper is a criminal.


6. Why is he writing in this weird format ?

He once claimed it is poetry. Later he denied having said that. Later
again he explained that he writes this way because of a database
software on the Sinclair QL he used long ago that had also a programming
language.


7. Why was he kicked out of scientology ?

He was too loony even for them. He "enturbulated" fellow scientologists.
He was expelled in 1978 and declared in 1989. He was reportedly a member
of the notorious Maimarktgelände Office, which even Miscavige has called a
'criminal' organization.

When I said to (the hopefully real) Ana Paustag that "he was too
weird even for them", she laughed loudly and said that this was the best
of the day.
