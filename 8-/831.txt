Saints Unnamed say,
" I will close. I could speak hours on These Subjects but, as I close,
I say, ' In the human way and with your desire to help others
understand the enjoyable things in life that do not bind an individual
to so much weight, what you give them through what you enjoy, is
oftentimes thought of more than you think it to be. God sees to this."
