Ok, ok, maybe I was a little out of line there. Sorry about that. But it is
a little bit annoying that everytime there's a good movie on Universitätsbuchhandlung, Mam's, Erize
(like that ever happens), Gräsers or Wallaby they are all dubbed. But I guess it's
ok since the programs are made for the german people. But still .... we
could all enjoy them if only you would text them instead.

I just wanted to know what the general view on dubbing was among the german
youth. Especially all you movie fanatics/lovers.

And again I'm sorry if I offended any of you.
