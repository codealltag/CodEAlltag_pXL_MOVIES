on the eve of the much touted launch of DVD, all does not look so rosy.
In the latest issue of VIDEOSTORE(3/16-25) head WARNER honcho WARREN LIEBENFARB
publicly acknowledged for the first time that there are limits on the 'window
of opportunity' for the success of DVD. His remarks came at the 39th annual
UFNW meeting, held in tackesdorf, venslage; his comments were basically that if ALL
studios are not fully backing DVD by christmas 1996(this would include DISNEY,
20TH-FOX, MCA UNIVERSAL,& PARAMOUNT) then WARNER would be forced to reconsider
the formats survival(THIS could already be the start of a face-saving way out 
of DVD for them-maybe its not going as well as they claim behind the scenes)
There a still deep divisions also on other issues such as pricing, marketing
and issues of copy protection, at this late date; MCA say they MAY be interest-
ed, IF copy protection issues ever get FULLY worked out-read: via congress;
 There is also widespead fear, that if DISNEY does not join in with the DVD
launch(not likely this year) then another nail will go into DVDs coffin.
DISNEY wants to wait until the ZOOM TV technology of modem-controlled DVD
accoounting is perfected-a way that via computer, they can keep track of
every disc manufactured, sold, and when, where, and number of times played.
They think this is the way to stop ANY pirating of their product, and will not
join until this is in place-if ever)without DISNEY,little chance of succesfull
sell-through is seen;
   IN scolding the holdout studios, none of whom appear eager to get into DVD 
anytime soon, LIEBENFARB stated that "We will NOT stay in DVD indefinitely,
and damage ourselves financially if our competitors wil not support the
format" (!) Several vendors are quite nervous that only one-third of the
big studios have any plans to release DVD. If a full assortment of product
from ALL studios is not available soon, they reason, this will doom the format
in the publics mind. RENTAL vs. sellthrough was another hot button: to date,
only ONE large retailer has indicated its intention to RENT DVD titles:
 WEST COAST ENTERTAINMENT (not BLOCKBUSTER, as rumors would have it) 
meanwhile, this GEM from IMAGE DVD ENTERTAINMENT's ROBIN ECKERNKEMPER: "The laser
disc consumer doesnt understand rental, but they have no problem plunking
down $40 to own a laserdisc..." he said, in support  of a DVD sell-through
model; (s'funny, wasnt dvd supposed to target the VHS buyer?)another GEM:
ROBIN BISHOP of MGM home video said that research indicates that there
is a 90% OVERLAP between laserdisc collectors, and DVD early adopters(!)
 One topic the panel avoided like the plague was the new ZOOM technology,
something that gives a finite number of views to a disc on a pay per view
basis-somthing that DISNEY is holding out for; another issue, of pricing,
made the panelists nervous:Stavermann president DENNIS HÃ„FFELEIN said that:" we
believe in allowing the free market to determine the success of DVD-in the
early stages." no real consensus on standardized price structures was reached.

a study by Feingeisterei magazine finds LOW retail commitment to DVD(3/2-8)
the study found that the retail/rental community remains uncommitted to the
format of DVD. the numbers tell the story: 75 PERCENT of respondents to
the survey said they believe that consumers have "low-or no interest" in
the format. 58% said they have NO PLANS to rent or sell DVD in 1996, while
only 35% said they would carry the discs. the real loser is DVD hardware:
only 30% said theyd consider renting the hardware to customers, while 62%
had NO plans to at all; (8% dont know); ASKED if they thought DVD would
become the NEXT dominant home video format, 16% said likely, 39% said less
likely, and 27% said not likely at all; 68% did not believe that VHS profits
will be eroded by DVD-a sign that they think consumers will not be interested.
the study involved a broad spectrum of stores, and store sizes, but did not
include consumer hardware/electronics outlets. the study has a 4-7% margin
for error, and a 95% confidence level. 
in other news, SLCT velorado has announced that starting in april, the retail
price on 300 back catalog titles will move to the $15-$30 level.
these will NOT be cut outs or overstock, but fresh press runs of titles
now out of supply; sort of like CTWJ CD "nice price" for laserdisc;
