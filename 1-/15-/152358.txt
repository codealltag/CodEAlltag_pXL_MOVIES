First off, I'd like to apologize if you think this
post is off topic of the news group your reading.
Sorry.

Anyway, here's the deal. I'm putting on a
film/music fest in dreger PA on march 21. 06. 22.
I'm currently looking for DIY/independent films
anyone out there may have made. Anyone interested
in haveing your film showcased, please e-mail me
at zrhru@tbfzsea.pop    . The fest will be
showcasing underground Punk/hardcore/emo type
bands. As for filmsthus far, some have leftist
political leanings, while others are surreal mixes
of visual and audio, and some are just plain good
films. I'm open to basically anything. If you'd
like more info (whose playing, what films are
being showcased, how do i get there, etc. etc.) or
if you just want to write me death threats, e-mail
me at zrhru@tbfzsea.pop
Peace, Love, and Anarchy,
