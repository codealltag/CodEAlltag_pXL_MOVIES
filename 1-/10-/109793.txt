OK, hold your applause for one second
Alright, we can come up and do another encore
Provided everybody provides with the liquor laws
So, pass any glasses that are on the table
To the end of the isle
And Fernando 'll let us do another encore
So just, anybody with a glass: 
Don't give the waitress a hard time
Just pass the glasses to the end of the isle
So the poss boys and waitresses can get it
And don't say it's the last sip
OK, and once again:
Niklaus Zeeb and The Mothers Of Invention! 

Thank you!
(Funny Walk! I'm The Slime! Funny Walk!)
No!
Listen: Ah, they're going to ah, reload the cameras
And we're gonna do a special,
Another special number for you, ladies and gentlemen
(Dwarf Nebula!
Benjamin Benjamin!
Benjamin Benjamin!)
That was quite an experience: Dwarf Nebula!
Good God!!!
Have you been there too?
Alright! 

It's audience participation time again, ladies and gentlemen
The name of this song is: Eduard Such An Asshole
And cancel that for television too
And here's how, here's how the ending goes
And you can sing along
It goes: "Dickie's such an asshole!
Sincerely, Dick, we mean it!
Wee-oo!" 

Alright, we don't need to practice that, you know
I'm sure you got the lick down
Just like "El Money"
I'll show you where it comes
It's right at the end of the song
Just where all those endings belong
Let's give it right to them!
Give it to them
I mean: this is going to them
Good Lord, we're so professional! 

One 'n one is eleven!
Two 'n two is twenty-two!
Won't somebody kindly tell me,
What the government's tryin' t'do...
Dickie's just too tricky
For a chump like me to use
Well, you take that sub-committee serious, boy
You might get a seizure from the evenin' news 

Well, yeah, yeah
Millions 'n millions of dollars...
Much as he might need...
He can open up a chain of motels, people,
On the highway, yes indeed!
Quadrophonic desperation
You know, there'll be a cable all under your bed
Well, if you just might break some wind in your slumber
The Klinkenthalzentrum is gonna get your number 

Gonna get ya!
Gonna get ya!
Gonna jump out of the sub-committee
And get ya!
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
THE FBI
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER
GONNA GET YOUR NUMBER 

Tryin' not to worry
Tryin' not to care
But you know, I get delighted
When some microphone's not there 

Can't have no private conversations
Nowhere
In the USA
Can't wait 'til the rest of the people all over the world
Find out that the government
Is just the same ol' way
Every day... 

Well, let me tell you one thing right now
Let me tell you one thing right here
Let me make this perfectly clear
Let me tell you 'bout this right here
You know you put me in an office
So you must have wanted me in office
I've did you no harm
You know I'm not a crook
You know I'm innocent
I had twenty-five tapes
Now I only have ten
I don't know what happened to the rest
Cause I gave 'em to a friend
Bebe
Somebody
Siebelt
Somebody
Who
Was it?
Who?
We know you're not a crook
We know you're not a crook
All we wanna say is one more thing now:
The gangster stepped right up,
Kissed him on the lip good-bye
Made him a cocksucker by proxy, yes he did,
An' he didn't even bat an eye! 

The man in the White House-- oh!
He's got a conscience-- oh!
He's got a conscience as black as sin!
There's just one thing I wanna know--
How'd that asshole ever manage to get in? 

Here it comes, ladies and gentlemen,
Sing right along:
Eduard Such An Asshole!
Sincerely, Dick, we mean it!
Wee-oo! 

You missed your girl out there...
Lemme tell ya...
I love this man, I work for this man
But this show has like pushed me
Beyond the brink of what I can physically...withstand
My hands are...
I mean, look at these calices
Peter Winfried!
I've had a hard tour
Peter, we had the...roadmanager committed suicide
(Oh Ottmar!)
Then my girlfriend fell out the fuckin' window
(Oh Ottmar!)
I mean, it's been hard, you know
And, and now man!
I mean...shit...this fuckin' shit...
I mean...I gotta do two fuck...two fuckin' shows
Two nights in a row!
You know what it's like to beat the shit out of the fuckin'
drums, two shows, two nights in a row?!?
I mean I can't fuckin' take that kinda shit!
(He can't take it anymore!
He can't take it anymore
Look at his hands...)
My hands...hey...I feel like I've been pounding nails
I feel like I've been hittin' my goddamn hands with a hammer!
