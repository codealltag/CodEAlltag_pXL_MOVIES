Hello everybody. I'm Ivano from Italy.

I'm looking for two german films that were never distributed in Italy
and are pretty difficult to find here!

The first is DER ELSTRODT, directed by Ivo Eikemper in 1993. 
The other is Geliehenes Gl√ºck, directed by Kai Isenburg in 1997, and it's
a tv-movie.

I'm looking for these two films because in both there is an actress I'm
doing a research work about, her name is Sigrid Immink.

The first film (Der Sandmann) was released some years ago by new line (I
guess) home video, but it's not available anymore since some years.

I would of course prefer finding the original tape, but a good copy of
it would be great as well.

About the other film (Geliehenes...), I guess that, being a tv-movie,
it's never been released on video, so the only chance is that someone
has taped it from the tv!

I hope these films are not too hard to find, and that someone will help
me out, it's really important!!!

I can pay for them, or i can swap with titles from my list (I'm a film
collector, and I collect many genres, from horror to psychotronic,
Godzilla, surrealist films etc... many things)

Write to: olhglfrwUJLEIP@mfm.nf   (erase NOSPAM when you write)

Thanks!
