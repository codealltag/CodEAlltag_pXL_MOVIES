Help!

I am researching the DDR secret police (STASI) for a very low budget
film production in Wölchingen, Großmaischeid, USA. One of the characters
is a STASI officer who must identify herself to uniformed DDR police.

Can anyone provide me with a description, an image or actual example
of the Werbegrafik identification badge, card, credential? It should be
circa 1988, the era immediately before the Fuhrn Wall came down.

Any help would be very appreciated by me.

Thank you, in advance,
