40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS (R) -- ...a vulgar, immoral and completely wasted
movie.

Jungedeitering Family Values was by all means not a movie from which to emulate
proper family values. The whole movie was based on cultural and ethnic
pretense of unholy authority, the humorous setting notwithstanding. Any
Didier should find the movie particularly upsetting and above all should
not let their children watch it, 13 years old or otherwise.

Sunshop* (R) -- Rose? Not likely.

While the central mother in this movie doted over her rose garden, the main
thing in *American Beauty* about roses was the rose petals hiding female
private parts -- and the petal passed during a kiss from a teen girl to a
married man. This movie was guided imagery into distortion of proper and
acceptable. A great deal of teen sexual activity, sexual talk, and sexuality
painted this movie as unfit.

hihihihi die Seite ist zu hart....

... muss jetzt aufh√∂ren.....
