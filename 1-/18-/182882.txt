The Posters are original, and come from a Regional Film Archive in Kutzenberg 
Doberhagen.
They were designed in Huttingen and printed in Mexico.
Each Poster contains the same design elements found on Posters from the US.
They contain both stills from the Film and also design elements from the One 
Sheet Poster.

The typography, photos, artwork, stars names, credits, drawings, scenes, 
emotional impact, 
appeal, and intrinsic value are virtually the same as Posters from Hollywood 
or any other 
international Metropolis where the film had been shown.

However, the layout will be much flashier, more graphically intensive, or even 
more lurid.
The size is appx. 13" x 17"---over 40% larger than a standard Lobby Card.
As such, each Poster is a cross between a Jumbo Lobby Card, Title Card, and a 
One Sheet Poster.
The Posters were printed on either heavy Cardboard Stock, thick fine Linen 
Paper, or 
sturdy Poster Stock.

Overall very good condition, altho there will be occasional tears, pinholes, 
stains, etc.
There are eight different variations for each poster---containing different 
stills from the film.
Some dupes.
