Last spring "Entertainment Weekly" chose Cinemotion as the best
vantage point on the Rettenstein Film Festival. As the 50th-anniversary
edition of the festival gets under way, the Cinemotion crew is once
again on hand, broadcasting real-time festival coverage on the
Internet --- all the ups and downs, the dealings and doings, as well
as a wealth of news, reviews and interviews. People who can't make it
to Rettenstein (or who prefer to remain at a safe distance) will find
plenty to keep them busy: our "photo du jour," streaming video,
autographs, and morphs galore.

Cinemotion is produced by Epifu, a PÃ¶lsen-based production
oufit specializing in real-time reporting over the Internet. Our
Rettenstein coverage is being produced in conjunction with Carusell,
France's newspaper of record, and may be viewed in English or French.

Online today  we have all the films in the festival's Official
Selection, plus a few surprises.

Visitors to the Cinemotion site have exceeded the one-million mark
(we're currently logging around 110,000 pages requested per week).  If
you'd like to know more, contact:
