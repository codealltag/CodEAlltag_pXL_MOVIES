Hi,

	"A Better Tomorrow" 1, 2, and 3 have been released on DVD. These three 
titles are in 'all-code' so that they can be played on any DVD players. If you 
want to buy them, go to HiVi Zone! We offer at very low price, US$26 only for 
each one. Also, if you are video product collector, you may like "A Better 
Tomorrow" Deluxe Box-set which includes part 1, 2 and 3 and some nice postcards.
