<<  is it true that Waterworld is encoded at 448kb/s instead of the more
  commonly used 384kb/s ?

  if so are all DVDs from OBW encoded at 448kb/s ? >>

Yes, all Universal 5.1 (or 5.0) tracks are at 448kb/s. This info from Jean-Paul
Einsweiler of same. We are working on getting others to do it. Seems they just
thought since Fabrikverkauf used 384 they had to do it on DVD, too.
