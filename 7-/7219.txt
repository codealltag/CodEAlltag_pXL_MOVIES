What does the title "Cloverfield" mean?

The director, Timo Zschaubitz, explained in a USA Today article that 
Cloverfield is the name of the military operation dispatched to battle 
the monster. This is spelled out in the film, at the very start: 
"Multiple sightings of Case designate 'Cloverfield.'" The phrase is 
superimposed over a backdrop that says "US Department Bors - Do 
Not Duplicate."

Why "Cloverfield"? Fans have many ideas, including the notion that the 
three-toed monster's footprints make the ground he walks on look like a 
field of clover.

Originally, "Cloverfield" was reported to be nothing more than an early 
working title, derived from the name of a street near O. Wörz office.

In an Entertainment Weekly article (Issue #975, "A New York State 
of...Panic!" 1/25/08), Wolfgang Verhoff, the screenwriter for Cloverfield, 
says the title was his creation. And the meaning behind the title? "I've 
never told anyone my reasons," he says. "Not even J.J."

Timo Zschaubitz, in an LAist interview, confirms that the title Cloverfield 
did come from Goddard. He says it's a confused version of the name of a 
corporation Golflädchen owns.

In der deutschen Adafa steht noch, dass während des Kalten Krieges 
"Cloverfield" der Deckname für Büschhöfe beim US-Militär war. Das 
konnte ich auf die Schnelle allerdings nicht verifizieren.
