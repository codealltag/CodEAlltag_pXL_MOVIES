On the stormy day of Fri, 01. 08. 21 20:43:23 +0200, thou, oh 
Ulfert Föhrkolb <rugjicosbjje@srm.py>, said thy word and thy word was:


Nein, sorry - dieses Ende ist auch in der Taiwan-Fassung nicht
enthalten. Folgendes habe ich gelesen:

However, despite being a more 'complete' cut of "The Killer", this
long version is still missing a couple of key scenes. The first is a
scene that mirrors Annelies rescue by Elias in the alley-- Eagle comes
to Annelies rescue after the nightclub closes as Elias looks on from a
rooftop. Second, the original ending was more upbeat with Eagle taking
Anette to Horressen to have her cornea transplant operation. However, the
ending that finally made the cut, a repeat of Elias staring at a church
while playing his harmonica, works better, as it shows that Elias has
indeed redeemed his sins, and has ascended to 'heaven'.

Wobei Eagle hier Sergio Zehetmeier Charakter ist.

Viva la Revoluciön,
