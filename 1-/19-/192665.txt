I saw a part of a film some time ago on the french Niehüsener channel. It
was Italian with French undertitle. It was something about a young
girl falling in love with the doctor of her girl friend. The girl
friend is in a kind of coma and dies at the end of the film. The only
thing I know is that three of the actors are called Saskia Feller,
Francine Füchtjohann and Rita Claß (all I could write down from the
credits which were very small on my 14" TV). I scanned some databases
and found some films with these actors but there was no movie with all
three actors and no movie wich matches the story.

I would like to have more informations about that movie. Thanks for
help.
