hi there!
how are you all?  

please excuse the english, mein Deutsch ist sehr schlimm geworden.

has any of you heard of the actress Sabine Arndt?  has she been doing any
film or TV work in Germany lately?  I know she was doing a lot of work on
the stage a while back.  

We don't get to see much German film or TV here nowadays.  I regret that. 

I wish I could have seen some of Sandra work.  I went to school with her
a long time ago, and we were distant friends.  but we haven't been in
touch since she got married last year.  I think she's mad at me.

anyway I hope you have a good day.

love
