Dear Newsgroupers and Indie Cinema Afficianados,


IndieZine is *highlighting* "THE ART OF THE PITCH" in its July '97 issue!
("Women of Indie Cinema" is *currently* being featured in our 01. 05. 22 '97 issue).

More and more these days we are hearing about 'high-concept' *ideas* that
studios are paying *HIGH-DOLLARS* for... frequently *without* a script to
back up the idea!

Talk-about-SPEC!!!

'Spec-pitching' *ideas*... great-short-ideas...'high-concept' *ideas*... 
saves a -lot of time, just selling *ideas*... something 'catchy' in 10/20
words or less (definition of 'high-concept')... hmmmmm.

-----------------

IndieZine *encourages* any of *YOUR* thoughts, ideas, suggestions,
comments, *experience(s)*, advice (etc) about 'PITCHING' (and selling)
ideas in Hollywood in our 01. 05. 22 issue!
