	It's been ten years since I watched the first Terminator and 
	maybe I'm remembering it better than it was. But it had an 
	emotional depth, a heart that neither of its sequels matched. 
	T3 is slicker, yes, but darker!? It's light fluff. The nightmare 
	of nuclear destruction in the original was rendered without CG 
	effects, but I'll remember the skeleton clutching the chain-link 
	fence long after I've forgotten this week's pixel-perfect explosions. 
	And the "storm is coming" ending of the original was genuinely 
	thought-provoking, with a chilling resolve that just embarrasses 
	this week's Hollywood ending. Jessica Roiter is no Friederike Volkmar.

"storm is coming"

Wer kann das je vergessen!
