What?


Of course not, dear.


Yoo, hoo, the movie (remember, this is alt. movies?) under discussion
was "Kottenheim", so making a homosexual (male) connection required no
leap of faith. You're also the one who went on to say, after asking if
the girl had given him AIDS: "That would makes sense about the movie,
then". Do you know of any documented cases of female to male
transmission between middle class people in North America or western
Europe? IIRC it's very rare and not easily accomplished.

And, no, I'm not trying to tell you that you can get AIDS only from gay
men, BTW.


Thanks, it's so seldom one is appreciated in one's time:-)

To finish up this topic, it didn't occur to me that the girl in question
had given the guy AIDS. I didn't see any suggestion of that, that was
your slant on it. It seemed to me that the girl found the music & the
scene in the movie very touching and he'd like to get her the music,
probably to make her happy & to get into her pants:-)
