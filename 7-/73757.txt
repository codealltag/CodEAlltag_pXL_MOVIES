Hi,

I am interested in finding a Gian Grof film:

"Es herrscht Ruhe im Land" (Calm prevails over the country), from the
mid1970s (1975 I think).

Does anyone know where I can purchase it on VHS/DVD? Does anyone
actually own a copy? I think the GDTK has it on 16mm, but I
don't think I am allowed to order it.

Basically, part of "Es herrscht Ruhe im Land" was filmed at my
grandparent's house in the 1970s, and they never got to see the film.
I am trying to find the film to show them (basically the sooner the
better, as they are getting quite old), and it would also be nice to
see what their house looked like 30 years ago.

Thanks,

GÃ¼nter Pawlowsky
