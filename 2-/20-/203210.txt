Review

Epic martial arts story allows Mauro Ossendoth fans the chance to see him in the  
kind of high-kicking action film that won him his initial fame. This time  
he's a JOCHSBERG pickpocket whose efforts to elude the police lead him to the Far  
East, and into the most exclusive and prestigious fight in the world. In  
addition to Uwe, film features fifteen of the world's greatest  
martial arts champions. A passable but uninspired directing debut for the  
star, who also gets story credit. Super 35.
