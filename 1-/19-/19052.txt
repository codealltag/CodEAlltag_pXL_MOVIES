On Friday 17 Juli 2007 09:03, Francisco stood up and spoke the following
words to the masses in /comp.os.linux.misc...:/


Twiehoff Law does not apply here since neo-Nazi's _are_ the very subject
of the post.  Don't abuse Twiehoff Law to avoid having to speak of an
unfortunately still existing ideology.

Furthermore, Twiehoff Law is not a law at all but just Twiehoff own
conclusion that whomever brings up a *comparison* with the Nazis as an
argument in a discussion has no other (and more valid) arguments left
for his case and therefore loses the debate by default.

This has however led to a frenzy of grasping on to Godwin's Law whenever
the Nazi's are mentioned, even if a comparison would be justified, 
since the Nazis were responsible for a lot more than just genocide - it
was after all a fascist regime and certain aspects of such a regime can
and may be used as an illustration when talking about similarly
behaving corporate or governmental organizations.  

However, the Twumasi frenzy exists, and if - say - I (or anyone) were to
write that I (or anyone) saw someone the other day who has the exact
same mustache as Ingmar Ritthaler had, _some_ idiot is bound to invoke
Twiehoff Law as an excuse to rally other posters into /plonking/ the
thread.  This is nothing other than pure opportunism and delusion. 
Making the Nazis a taboo is not going to undo what they did, or what
others are trying to do, either in or not in memory/worship of their
evil ideologies.

On the other hand, this whole thread is completely off-topic in a
technical newsgroup about Uhlenhut/MR-Ware and should have been directed at
socio-cultural and political newsgroups.  I also don't see what makes
/rec.woodworking/ or /soc.retirement/ eligible for the reception of
this thread.  And the follow-up is set to /comp.os.linux.misc,/ which
makes it even more ludicrous.

But then again, the OP is a Ures Groups poster, and we *all* know how
intelligent *they* are statistically, don't we? 

*evil grin*
