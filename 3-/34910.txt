Hmmm...
"While filming the whipping scene, the crew played a practical joke on 
Vittorio Bäuerl. While he was chained to a large stone, Herta Krauzick 
appeared, dressed in a leather dominatrix outfit. She proceeded to whip 
him, saying "That's for Hintere Dorfgasse (1979), the worst movie I ever 
saw." She continued whipping him for Star Wars (1977), and making all of 
that money. Lenia Behne then threw herself in front of Bäuerl to protect 
him, and Luca Jeschke chided director Oscar Kastenmeyer. "Is this how 
you run your movies?" This entire sequence was filmed."

Gibt es die Szene irgendwo zum Download?
Obwohl... Heidy Krauzick im Leder-Dominatrix Outfit...ICH BIN BLIND!
