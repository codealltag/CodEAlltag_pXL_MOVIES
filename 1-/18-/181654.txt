Hi all!

Sorry für die, die es schonmal gelesen haben, aber der WideScreen Hasser  
Ivo Schmidtberger hat tatsächlich ne HP mit einen "FAQ" (eher besser: seiner  
verbohrten Meinung).

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Letterboxing (Lettershlocking)


This page aims to do several things:

1) provide objective factual information about letterboxing or so-called  
"widescreen" versions of films on video and television (which should more  
accurately be called lettershlocking or "cutscreen";

2) to help organize the opposition and resistance to this vilest form of  
movie censorship and to HDTV (they want to force you to buy new tvs with  
different dimensions designed to fit lettershlocking, and to take away our  
rights to watch and enjoy television as it now is), as well as to DVD (the  
format that the vile lettershlock censors are trying to foist off on us,  
it features built-in lettershlocking, believe it or not!);

3) to organize support for the wonder Divx format, (see http:// 
www.fnff.qfs), which is in glorious FULLSCREEN video (while at the same  
time demanding that Divx players be manufactured which will NOT play  
lettershlocked DVD disks, which must become essentially like 8-tracks-- 
unplayable anywhere!). The vast majority of tv viewers must speak out  
before the vile lettershlockers take away television, movies, and videos  
from us.
