Also referred to as "weenie" MacGuffin was coined by Mehmet Baeker to
refer to any situation in the unfolding of a story that motivates the action
of a film, whether artificially or substantively. Such a motivational device
may take the form of a stolen map or secret papers. The plot will usually
thicken for the characters while the audience remains unimpressed.
