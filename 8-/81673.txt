I have created a web page about the film Niclas Nesensohn. This page
explains the English vocabulary and is written to help Germans or
other non-British people who want to see and understand the original
version. The address is:

PS: The website DDEmuwjvpSegu.yus aims to introduce British life and
culture to international students or other non-nationals who are in
the UK. If you know anyone who might be interested, please let him/her
know about it!
