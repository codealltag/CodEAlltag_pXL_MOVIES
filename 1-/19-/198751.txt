[ Sorry, I don't speak German :) ]

We have a foreign exchange student from Germany staying with us.  Her 
favorite movie is called "Pappa Ante Portas".  I would like to see it.  
So, two questions:

1. Is it available in English anywhere?  (probably not)
2. Is it available in German in NTSC format?  (maybe)

I don't expect to find it and see it, but I just thought I would check to 
see if it was possible somehow.  Thanks!
