For about ten years ago we were watching a film in TV.It was in german and
as I recall
it was a kind of silly movie about some detective where the people suddenly
start
dancing and singing.I seem to remember that the film or one of the songs in
it was
called "Mein freund Ernst".
Now one of my friends is going to be 30 and wants to have this film for his
birthdaypresent.Could somebody help me to find out how to get hold of this
film.
