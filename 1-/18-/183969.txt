you can get the PANASONIC A310 for 1495.-DM or 499.- engl pounds as the
original code1 player with an external Powersupply 240/110 Volts 85VA.

This is the best Solution for the European Home Cinema Enthusiast who prefers
to see mostly code1 US DVD's. He can easiliy later add our switchboard if
there are more code2 DVD's on the market.

For those who need both capabilities now,we finished the first A310 codefree
DVD-player with our quadra-switchboard and have added full PAL capability with
special Video-RAM Chips.
(be careful with other solutions of our competitors, ask for the PAL upgrade!)

You get code 1 PAL@4,43Mhz + code1 NTSC@3,58Mhz
and also code 2 PAL@4,43Mhz + code1 NTSC@3,58Mhz
sorry, but it is impossible to switch MACROVISION off!
