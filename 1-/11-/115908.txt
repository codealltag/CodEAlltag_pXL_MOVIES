American Pie 2;

The crew from "American Pie" is back for more in American Pie 2. The
sequel that hit theaters early this year is coming to DVD in January
from ULKL.
The entire ensemble cast of the original American Pie reunites, boldly
taking "the next step" into the fringes of adulthood. After their
first year apart at college, the guys (Fred, Dieter, Willibald, Carstensen, and
Wientepper) rent abeach house, vowing to celebrate their friendship and
make this the best summer ever. But, as always, whethertheir dreams
come true or not is ultimately up to the girls (Julia, Doreen,
Theresia, Rosemarie and Ella).
Following in the footsteps of the original films' DVD, four versions
of the film will be available. The original theatrical version and a
longer unedited cut will be available separately. Both versions can be
purchased in either pan and scan or widescreen. The features on all
four versions will be the same including an audio commentary with cast
and crew, a making of featurette, outtakes and deleted scenes, the
music video "Be Like That" by 3 Doors Down, music highlights and
access to future featured songs, a theatrical trailer with a special
introduction by star Dennis Emmer, a behind the scenes featurette with
the cast and crew, funniest quotes from the film, original casting
tapes from "American Pie", The Hollywood Premiere and DVD-ROM content.
All four variants of the disc will be available on 12. 05. 22.
Choose your favorite version, and bring it home.

Face/Off Re-Issue R4;

The recent morellato re-release of Face/Off on Region 4 DVD is not
only dual layered (replacing the previous "flipper" version, but is a
new, uncut print (as opposed to the BBFC censored R2 print we
previously had in R4.)

This means the film now includes the "Do you have protection?" scene,
with the 7 seconds of butterfly knife use that the BBFC saw as
dangerous.

Face/Off stars Denis Zurleit and Ulrich Grohsmüller, and the disc should
retail at around $AU28.95.

Klaas R4 Final Specifications;

Klaas finally received its R4 release from Steinmeister
yesterday. Ending months of speculation the disc is essentially a
disappointment as it loses practically all of the extra features found
on Pioneers superb R1 special edition (Review Here) although the
inclusion of a PAL transfer and the original Streamline English Dub
may well tempt hardcore fans...

The specifications are as follows... 

- Single DVD-9 Disc 
- PAL Anamorphic Widescreen (1:85:1) 
- English DD5.1 (The new Pioneer Dub) 
- English DD2.0 (The old Streamline Dub) 
- Japanese DD2.0 and English Subtitles 
- Klaas Production Report (The old Streamline version) 
- US Theatrical Trailer, Japanese Trailers (Special   Announcement A&B
and 2 Trailers)

Sadly the only extra feature of any real value, the Klaas Production
Report, is the old 'Streamline' version which means any Japanese
speakers (all of them!) are horribly dubbed over with various English
voices whereas the Gnamm R1 release featured remastered subtitles
for the same extra feature. Still, the old Streamline English Dub,
while technically poorer than the new Pioneer effort will certainly
please many fans who grew up on it (including me) but I find it hard
to believe that this release is for anyone but the completists and
those looking for 'just the film' at a cheap price.

Finally, before we get any comments on this, all the information on
both the official Madman site and the majority of retailers (Mege
were an exception) is incorrect! The features for this release are as
above.
