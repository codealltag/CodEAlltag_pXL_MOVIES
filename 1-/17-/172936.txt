DO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF FEAR OF DEATH?

The death is that equalizes all on the Earth: both rich and poor, black and
white, old and young. And I with you speak on equal, as the man who has
survived clinical death. Each day you go with fear of death in your heart,
each day you are afraid to die. And whether it costs to be afraid of it so
much?
It's up to you to decide. I only want to inform  you what has changed my
life after my death.
In this state I saw one of episodes of the other world distinctly.
I stood behind a throne and watched, as He spoke with two, same, as I. He
told one of them: " you were generous, when endowed for church, but your
generosity went not from the heart. You sacrificed, but not because of love
to me and repentance, but looking in this for the benefit for yourself. You
wanted to buy my mercy ".
He told to another one: " you have never remembered me, but one of your
deeds I didn't forget. Not long ago He has addressed you and you have helped
Him. It wasn't a big loss for you, it wasn't more than 1/3 that you have had
and you were in easy circumstances. When I have called you to me, both of
you were not in need. You did not think of the benefit, you did not think of
me, you simply had helped Him ".
What happened to these people later - I do not know, and I have no need to.
I was returned! And when a bit later I have recollected what I saw and
heard, it became clear to me what He wanted  to transfer to me.
Find the one you wanted to help with a pure heart. Or wait for the hour,
when He will address you for help. And may be He is addressing you just now?
If you think so, if the idea about finiteness of your stay in this world has
put up in your heart, HURRY UP! You can help yourself just now!
