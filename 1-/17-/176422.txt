While having the ability to select the blanking level and type of
component output is an obvious improvement, I'm surprised that somebody
(i.e. legal eagles from hardware/software manufacturers) hasn't cracked
down on the regional-coding and Macrovision defeats included in these
mods.  Both of these are security measures that the movie studios wanted
built into the DVD specification to control distribution and to prevent
analog duplication of their intellectual properties (the films
themselves).  Don't get me wrong, when I get a DVD player it will most
definitely have the Macrovision permanently removed from the video chain
(I'm not so concerned with the regional coding), but I'm not going to
sell my mods on the Net!  That's getting a bit too border-line for me! 
:-)  Just my $0.02 worth.
