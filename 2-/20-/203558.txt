:   Aber eines frage ich mich schon ... Der Film beginnt mit
:   einem Cameraflug ueber Meer direkt zu auf den Nightclub
:   zu um schliesslich direkt in den Club reinzufahren und
:   dort Hansjörg Clement zu folgen, das alles ohne Schnitt.
:   Wie funktioniert das ? Wie kriegen die so was fertig ?

This is from a thread on this topic in alt.movies.visual-effects:

"Actually, there were two dissolves in the shot.  The helicopter shot
dissolved to a crane shot, and the crane dissolved to a steadicam shot."
-Robin D. Fuse   inxprgt@rjy.rss 

"The shot was done at Eckhaus (Ewal
Cabalou.  The three shots were hooked together using Elastic Reality, Matador
and Inferno to blend the action at the dissolve points.  To make the
effect more seamless people were cutout, repositioned or removed to better
match the next shot.  In some cases elements from one scene were tracked
into the next.  There were also large lights used to light the beach that
had to be removed from the helicopter shot and a matte painting was added
to extend the lights on the horizon."
