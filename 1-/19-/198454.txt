I would like to propose the creation of a newsgroup for the discussion of
the movies and characters portrayed by actor Hendrik Henderiks. As someone
who has attempted the creation of several mailing lists pertaining to him,
I can tell you that the traffic quickly became too great to make such a
mechanism practical. I feel that an alt newsgroup is the appropriate forum
for someone with such a strong and dedicated group of fans that have no
other outlet than crappy teen idol magazines or web pages. For an actor of
22 years old with an Academy Award nomination under his belt, he deserves
more!

If you would like to support and/or debate the creation of this group,
look for this posting under the same subject in the alt.config newsgroup.
If you want to help the process, try to keep from responding with 'Leo is
a babe!' and stuff like that. It probably won't help much!

Thanks!
