For my sins I had a look and it's quite good actually.  Nicely set out and
presented.  Didn't read it though, having read the rants a million times
before.  By the way, anyone noticed Jean-Paul Ippach looking at you funny
during Man O Man yet?  Thought not...

:Yes, I have to be honest: that page is one of the best examples of how to
:present a long document on the Web that I've seen. Hopefully, frames will
:become more and more prevalent and this style of presentation will become
:the norm for long documents such as that.

My html thingy doesnt seem to do frames so all I got was a blank page. Then
again, maybe someone, somewhere doesn't want me to read it.

BTW does 'troll' bring to mind a fishing lure (ie you are American), or an
ogre type thing (ie you are European). I much prefer the image of the latter.

Now, whatever you might think about the content, this is a very well
designed and presented web page (if you use Netscape to look at it
anyway - Mosaic couldn't handle it).

This is my article, not my employer's, with my opinions and my disclaimer!
