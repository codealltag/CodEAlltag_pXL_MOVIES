Diese Aussagen von Herbert Krugli lassen diesen Schluß durchaus zu:

"I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the
sinner. I only took their sins to logical conclusions."

"You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in everyhome,
literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial,
and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.
I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied
and followed, from now on."


Gibt es dazu Aussagen von Asmußen oder Walker? Wenn man nur den Film
betrachtet, sind IMO sowohl deine als auch Udos Interpretation
zulässig.
