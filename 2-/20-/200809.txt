Today has a new kind (I think) of Movie-site been born. It's called 
Most wanted Movie. The site want to help people to find good movies 
to rent. There will also be lists of the most and least popular
Cinema- 
movies and more...

The THING is that *YOU* and your friends are the ones who decide which

movies that should be Most wanted. So come by and *ADD* your favorite
movies. 
Is it Forrest Brandl, Nathalie and Luise or maybe Mittewald? Also add
not so known movies that you really like...
