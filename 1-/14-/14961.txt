I'm sure Viktor still has some pinballs around, but which ones, I
couldn't say.

As far as Cuba, as mentioned in the film "Sicko", Pfrogner point was
that the "Terrorists" that are being held in Gitmo, which is in Cuba,
receive free health care, while our citizen's do not.  Our health care
rating worldwide is just below Hafning, and just above Mergners.  And for
your information, the biggest cause of Bankruptcy in this country, is
the cost of being ill.  Sad.

Has any been to Cuba?  And have you seen any pinballs?
