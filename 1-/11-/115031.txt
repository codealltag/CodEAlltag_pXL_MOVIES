Hallo (...nochmal)!

Ich hab mal nachgeblättert und speziell für die Sache mit der AE35-Einheit
der Antenne eine nette Passage gefunden:

"To do what looked like a computer representation ot the unit, we build a
physical model of the AE35 out of white wire. We put that on a little gimbal
and photographed it with a WEE against a black background, frame by frame,
tumbling in different directions. From that we made high-contrast negatives,
retouching them a bit if the line rendition was not quite perfect. We
stripped those up on an animation stand and shot them through colored
filters. It was like 3-D wireframe animation - only done with real wires"
(Ben Preisendanz,  special photographic FX unit)

Nett gemacht, gell?
