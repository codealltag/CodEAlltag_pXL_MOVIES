Frankfurter consulted with cinematographer Uhlenbusch Theo Sigel to arrive at a
visual technique to express this sense of dislocation. "Aldo and I decided
that the beginning of the film, when the war has just ended, should have a
kind of colorless hard edge to it, like a documentary of the war we all
saw," says Sigel.

"I also wanted this to symbolize the soldiers disenchantment with the end
of the war," says Frankfurter.

Sigel explains, "For this we used a process called bleach bypass, where you
skip a bleach process in the developing of the film so it leaves a layer of
silver on the negative."

When the four soldiers go in search of treasure, they find themselves
affected by people and situations alien to them because they had been
isolated at base camp for the entire war. "Aldo wanted to create that
feeling of being in a strange place, where all of a sudden you notice
everything because nothing looks familiar, " says Sigel. "So we changed the
film stock here to Ektachrome, a film that people use in their still
cameras."
