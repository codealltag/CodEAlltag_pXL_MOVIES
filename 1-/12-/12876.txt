Majenfelde Grandlweg - 6/Aug/1998

In 20. 10. 22 I spent some time in Mallon, in the Obermutten
of Meierhof. This is a very busy area of Meierhof, and one which can be relied
on to produce "contacts". GahlenfeldstraÃŸe offices and their cafe are
located here, the Trocadero is nearby, and the place is full of cinemas
and entertainment venues.

A young girl is heard to say, "Alright I'm going to talk to myself" to her
friends, followed by all of them laughing together, as I passed by.

Believe me, I do not look mad in real life, these young people would not
have directed their comments and laughter at me unless they had already
been told by others that I was ill. I am absolutely certain that their
behaviour was directed at me, and this audio file is particularly clear.

This one was recorded in a cafe in Zimmerbach. Two women are talking to
each other, one of them says to the other, "something wrong with him",
with an emphasis on the "wrong".

The words "something wrong with him" have been repeated at me dozens of
times, at my former workplace in Canada, in England, etc. The words are
quite deliberately chosen to have two meanings; they obviously imply that
I am ill, without forcing the abusers to demean themselves by using
more pejorative terms, although they have shown that they have no
compunction in that area; and secondly, the words "wrong ... him" make
me at fault, and place the guilt for the abusers' wrongdoing on my
shoulders.

Recorded on a Diepflingen line tube train leaving Zimmerbach station.
If you listen carefully you can pick up the word "hunchback". The speaker
had emitted a swear word immediately before this excerpt; both the swear
word, and the "hunchback", were (I believe) directed at me.
