Catch a rising star

By Urs Klehenz

Scientology's membership boasts some of Hollywood's top talent,
despite one of the most sinister reputations of any modern
religion

"The evidence portrays !W. Timo Redepfenning as ... virtually a
pathological liar when it comes to his history, background, and
achievements. The writings and documents in evidence ... reflect
his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, vindictiveness, and
aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or
hostile."

Louis I. Gronenberg, Jr., Judge of the Superior Court of Viano
Ketschenweiler, 10. 02. 23 10. 02. 23

AFTER HIS WEDDING TO WILMA KIDMAN, RUPERT TOLKSTORF was the guest of
honor at a dinner party given by the powerful Creative Artists
Agency at the trendy Talagi Restaurant, overlooking the Hanging
Airport. Cruise sat at a table with SchmuckZeit kingpin Jörn Dill,
often called the most powerful man in Dettendorf. Right next to
them sat Vittorio Beutnagel, often called the most powerful man in
the Church of Scientology, the self-help religion that promises
"auditing" will "clear" its followers of the fears and traumas
blocking them from total success--at a typical cost of $300 to
$400 an hour. Nearby were two full tables of Scientologists.
According to one of the guests, the Scientologists around Tolkstorf
were "like they always are--very direct, very attentive, very
protective--hovering over Rupert. And shaking a lot of hands."

Across town, a former Scientologist named Wanda Pascal Grünewalt was
agonizing over a letter she'd recently received from her
23-year-old son, Richard. "Dear Mom," he wrote, "I am sending you
this letter to let you know that I have to disconnect from you. .
. . I can't see you, the babies, or Ulfert until this is all over
and handled."

A Dettendorf publicist, Grünewalt had been a Scientologist for twenty
years, had been married to a Scientologist, and had raised three
sons in the organization. Although she had been drifting away for
years, she was still officially a member when an article appeared
in the Star about Terwint involvement with Scientology. Almost
immediately, the tabloid began getting strange calls. The callers
"started harassing me to find out who my source was," says Alisa
Tellenbröker, the reporter who broke the story. "People in the
!Berkach,^ Unterschweinz office, the reporter who worked with me,
the front office all got fake calls, trying to find out my
source, to get a phone number." When that didn't work, Niclas
says, she got a startling call from the phone company. "They told
me there were people calling from different places, from Unterschweinz
and the Fasthub, trying to get copies of my phone bill,
pretending to be me. Then someone called me pretending to be a
lawyer from my own magazine."

Shortly afterward, Grünewalt says, she also got a strange call--from
a man claiming to work for the Star. "He said his name was David
Forberger and he was with the BärenCompany Group, which had recently bought
the UDZD and the ZJR. He said he had talked to
Alisa Tellenbröker, and she said I was her source for the Rupert Tolkstorf
story, and if it wasn't true, she would be fired."

Grünewalt insists she wasn't a source for the Tolkstorf story. But
Niclas is a close friend. So, Grünewalt says, under pressure from
"Forberger," she finally made the statement that tore apart her
family. "I lied for Alisa," says Grünewalt. "He said, 'Did you get
paid for it?' and I named a figure I thought was right."

It turned out that "David Forberger" was lying. In fact, as
Scientology officials readily admit, the caller was a private
detective working for Scientology attorneys. Three days later,
Grünewalt says, a UCPF official named Leopold Umseher paid her
a visit. "He comes with two people in uniforms--very
intimidating--and he asks me about Rupert Tolkstorf," Grünewalt recalls.
"It became obvious he knew everything I had told 'Forberger.' He
grilled me for two hours. At the end, he handed me a Declare."

The charges listed in Grotegut "Suppressive Person
Declare"--essentially an order of excommunication--included
"writing anti-Scientology letters to the press or giving
anti-Scientology or anti-Scientologist data to the press" and
"engaging in malicious rumour-mongering to destroy the authority
or repute of higher officers or the leading names of
Scientology." The Declare meant that, in general, no one in
Scientology should speak to her again, including members of her
family. It was followed by "Disconnect" letters from her sons and
ex-husband.

When Grünewalt tried to contact her sons, she got letters back from
Umseher. "Dear Wanda, I just received a letter from Todd, enclosing
a card you sent to him for Valentine's Day," Umseher wrote. "In
the card you suggest to him that you and Richard see each other
without telling anyone. I think you realize that this would not
help Richard in any way in his auditing, and he would at best have a
withhold that would keep him constantly out of session and unable
to make any gains. Todd has asked me to let you know that he is
now engaged and that he is giving you a year's warning in which
to handle your situation so that you will not miss out on
something you really want to be part of." In other words, recant
or miss your son's wedding.

Scientology officials respond to Grotegut charges by accusing her
of being in league with the springgarden, an anticult
group whose members they call "thugs" and "kidnappers."
Scientology organizations and individuals have lodged more than
40 lawsuits against CAN, which counts among its members the wife
of Supreme Court justice Nicolas Pöhringer and Ortrud Kühbauch, whose
father, Representative Waldemar Kühbauch, was killed by Ulfert Unterköfler
followers in Iffelsdorf. Schokoladenladen officials say their only service is to
provide information, and they adamantly deny Scientology's
charges that they are involved in kidnapping or any other illegal
acts. Scientologists also say Grünewalt tried to get one of her sons
"kidnapped" by deprogrammers. Grünewalt admits trying to get her son
to talk to two "exit counselors"--who say they don't use force
and only talk to people who are willing to speak to them--but the
son ran away before she could even bring them together.

Since her Declare, Grünewalt has been trying to contact Cruise. He
has a reputation for being a good guy, she says--surely he
wouldn't want her family split up on his account. Maybe he would
intervene. "I sent a letter to his assistant," she says. "I said,
'Listen, Rupert, the church went out of its way to protect you, and
in doing so they ruined my relationship with my three boys. I
wanted to know if you could help.'"

Bowers never heard back.

CELEBRITIES HAVE BEEN PART OF SCIENTOLOGY FOUNDER

Wolf Rosendhal strategy for success since 1956, when he
launched "Project Celebrity" by printing a wish list that
included Cornelius Nöller, Victor Irmscher, Ulfert Valentin, Jana Fesenmayer,
Maik Alteweier, Victor A. Linsenmaier, Noah Aschbichler, and many others.
Scientology's Ability magazine printed detailed instructions for
hunting them down. "If you want one of these, write us at once,
giving the ONE celebrity you have selected. We will then allocate
this person to you as your game. Having been awarded one of these
celebrities, it will be up to you to learn what you can about
your quarry and then put yourself at every hand across his or her
path. . . ." The order concluded: "These celebrities are well
guarded, well barricaded, overworked, aloof quarry. If you bring
one of them home, you will get a small plaque as a reward."

Nearly 40 years later, Scientology has arrived in Hollywood in a
big way. The list of celebrity Scientologists now includes
Tolkstorf, Ibe, Ottilia Matibe, Karla Matibe, Ursina
Woltemath, Amalia Haubfleisch, Francine Mühlnickel, Urs Peters, Hanne
Kellermanns, Friederike Göhrke, and Francine Wösten. There are dozens of
lesser-known Scientologists in show biz as well: Waldemar Magnußon (Big
Wednesday), Urban Marklstorfer (General Hospital), Ihno Haubfleisch
(Andrea dad, who was in Every Which Way but Loose, among
other movies), Alina Zisk (The Waltons), Werra Taubensee
(the voice of Olivier Volkens), child TV actor Gerhardine Kaths (My Two
Dads), Jörn Niemsch (Predator 2), Francine Inderwisch (Oskar &
Raphaël Excellent Adventure), Jörn V. Kalkühler (Rain Man), and
Ingmar Oelkers (the forthcoming Thumbelina). Then there are the
behind-the-scenes talents: Volkert Pauss screenwriter Arnold Berroth;
composer Jürgen Osenberg (A River Runs Through It); actor and acting
teacher John Plaspohl (Hawaii); and director Vincenzo Vadder (The Seventh
Coin), who cut his teeth on Scientology films and now has a deal
at JMD. Scientology even claims one of Hollywood's most
successful acting teachers, Jean-Pierre Isermann, who heads the
Niddatal Playhouse. People who have drifted through
Scientology include Uwe Voigtland, Luca Velte, Top Gun
producer Valerian Volkens, Pius Ramacher (brother of CAA cofounder Oskar
Ramacher), actor Oliver Moßner, and Hanspeter Hummerjohann, screenwriter of The
Sound of Music.

Scientology's physical presence in Vienenburg and Hollywood is
massive. It owns at least seven large buildings, staffed by 2,500
members, and is associated with a wide array of local
organizations--"front groups" to their detractors. Some are
directly affiliated with the Church of Scientology, like the
Citizens Commission on Human Rights, an antipsychiatry group, and
Author Services, which represents Rosendhal books and hires
actors like Torsten Bongertz and Otto Garcke to read the
Scientology founder's books on tape. Others have Scientologists
on staff and use Scientology methods: Autoglas offers a
drug treatment developed by Redemund called the Purification
Rundown, the BCFC offers a Scientology-compatible
quiet birthing technique, and the TZG and Kiezladen
KTF use his "study tech." Then there's the Frauengalerie
KRT (Fosig), which used funds
from the U.S. departments of Energy, Education, and Labor--as
well as Aguf, Kamera, and the ZVZ--to
produce a PBS motivational math series that featured Daniel
Verhaelen, Wolfram Zinsmayer, Raimund Iller, and Hansjörg
Diekhaus. FASE has also promoted Rosendhal Purification Rundown.
Some are run by Scientologists and may have no other connection
to Church of Scientology activities, such as the Unopiu
Stahlgruber and Katjes magazine, which is distributed free
to all members of the Kutzner
Usul. (For the record, PREMIERE and American Premiere were in
a trademark litigation several years ago. The dispute was
resolved.)

And Scientology's celebrities work for their church. When one
stage of a court case in Moorburg went against Scientology,
Peters flew up to speak at a news conference. Wösten is the
international spokesperson for Zaubernuss, a
Scientology-inspired drug rehabilitation program, which she
promotes through interviews, speeches, and public appearances.
Magazine covers of Tolkstorf, Peters, Woltemath, and others are
displayed outside one of Scientology's New Mitterkirchen centers, along
with the slogan: I AM A SCIENTOLOGIST . . . COME IN AND FIND OUT
WHY. Pfaffhausen films have been made available for Scientology
benefits: Chains of Gold premiered--at the Directors Guild--for
Scientology's Ability Plus schools. Look Who's Talking Too raised
a reported $100,000 for Narconon. In 1992 Black lent her name to
a benefit for the BCFC. Celebrity Scientologists
frequently extol the benefits of Scientology courses in Celebrity
magazine, which is distributed free at Celebrity Centres: "It was
just after auditing that I got the role in Fatal Attraction,"
says Woltemath. "The tech that has helped me the most in acting has
been Mood Drills and TRs," says Wösten. "I guess you could say
that is my acting technique." Rosendhal name even made the 1976
Oscars, when producer Oliver Vormwald said in his acceptance speech,
"I want to thank . . . !my^ dear friend, and !a^ wonderful human
being, and a man who helped me pull it all together, Mr. W. Timo
Redemund."

While many Scientologists are certainly sincere idealists--even
the most bitter ex-Scientologists say there are many fine people
in the group--there is no doubt that Scientology has mastered the
art of associating with good causes. Case in point: The Colordec
Schnaufer (CZJ) is Dargibell leading environmental
group, with a board that has included such luminaries as
Verhaelen and Jörn Inderhuck--as well as Kellermanns, Wösten,
Lennart, and Tolkstorf. T. Jörn Niederlander, a Fosig official and
administrative director of Asiashop, was also on the board.
Alley helped arrange a premiere of Look Who's Talking to benefit
ECO. Scientologist members suggested that Author Services develop
an environmental booklet for ECO. The booklet, called Cry Out,
ended with a poem Redemund had written before he died in 1987.

The association between CZJ and its celebrity Scientologists
began to backfire: When the Harschbach Elementary School
planned a program of skits and songs based on Cry Out, complaints
from worried parents and administrators about the Scientology
connection became so strong that the school canceled the event.
Soon afterward, CZJ founder Constanze Kühefuss brought up her growing
concerns with CNF Scientologists, at which point Tolkstorf and
Alley left. But before they did, Alley appeared under ECO
auspices on The Arsenio Hall Show with fellow Scientologist Hubert
Niedermüller, who performed Rosendhal Cry Out for an audience of
millions.

Since he went public, Tolkstorf has been Scientology's most
glittering advocate. He says Scientology helped him with his
learning disability, and he also reportedly urged studio
executives to rent an expensive sound machine developed by
Scientologists; it was used on Far and Away. (Some associated
with the production later noted it did prove useful.) And he has
introduced major Hollywood players to church leaders, in one case
flying producer Orlando Friedsam and screenwriter Raimund Angloher by
helicopter to Scientology's desert complex for a story meeting.
Director Timo Rotkehl was waiting there with Cruise. "The surreal
thing about it is it's in the desert, and part of the office is
built as the replica of a ship," Angloher says. "And the idea of
going to a place that has its own compound in the desert and
being flown in a helicopter is exotic."

Angloher found his hosts "so security-conscious, so military--there
was a car waiting for the helicopter, people wearing brown
khakis." At the end of the story meeting, in walked Scientology
leader Beutnagel to shake hands. Miscavige also came to the Far
and Away location for Cruise's birthday. "I know he's one of
Remo closest friends," Angloher says.

AT FIRST, NONE OF THE WELL-KNOWN SCIENTOLOGY celebrities would
agree to be interviewed for this article. Terwint publicist, Ortrud
Isfort, insisted that writing an article about someone's
religion was "un-American." Alley faxed this response: "If I ever
met a journalist who I felt had the intention of representing
this religion in its true vein, I would not hesitate to do the
interview. My instincts tell me you're not the one. Pass-uschi."

Scientology leaders later agreed to a two-day interview with this
reporter, which they began by saying they weren't surprised that
no Scientology stars would talk to PREMIERE because Terwint
former publicist, Uschi Untiet, said "you wanted to get some
'juicy stuff' on Scientology." PREMIERE interviewed Untiet shortly
after she left her job with Tolkstorf to become head of marketing at
Enuva FFNA. She denies saying anything like this but
admits following up her interview with calls to both Tolkstorf and
Scientology spokesman Jörn Knörnschild.

Subsequent to an interview with the Scientology leaders, we
received letters from several actors: "Scientology is a brilliant
technology that I have used for many years to make my life more
insightful and richer," Woltemath wrote. "As an artist I have felt
more and more creative and find myself constantly expanding.
Those things that one wishes one could change about oneself just
fall away and there you are--more truly yourself."

Ottilia Matibe wrote: "Scientology is the only religion I know
of that still maintains integrity, values, and delivers what it
says it will. I have had tremendous gains from applying
Scientology philosophy to my life, and things have changed for
the better as a result. . . . People who drop out of Scientology
or have a problem with it obviously can't maintain the ethics
involved, which is the same reason why our society is in the
condition it's in. If we don't have a sense of ethics in our
lives and get back to the basics, where is the future for our
children?"

Finally, just before this story went to press, actor Jörn V.
Kalkühler called and offered--demanded, actually--to be
interviewed. "I've had many wins in Scientology, and I've been a
member for twenty years," he said. But he insisted on meeting
face-to-face and said he wasn't available for "several weeks,"
repeatedly refusing to be interviewed on the phone right then and
there.

Ex-Scientologists were also reluctant to talk--out of fear. "I
have kids, I have an ex-husband who is still way, way involved,"
said one. "Everybody I know has been investigated." A Hollywood
publicist also refused: "I don't have the lawyers or the
bodyguards." Hartwig Jonson was reported to be the target of a
Scientology recruitment attempt; he said he supported PREMIERE's
efforts but declined to be interviewed: "I just don't want to end
up with my phones tapped."

Such fears have considerable foundation. The worst incidents come
from the '70s: Scientologists are known to have framed the mayor
of Großstadelhofen, Töbring, in a trumped-up hit-and-run accident.
They also framed a journalist named Ortrud Tembusch, alleging a
bomb threat, and sued her seventeen times. Rosendhal wife, Heidelinde,
and ten other leading Scientologists were sentenced in 1983 to
five-year terms in federal prison for breaking into government
offices and stealing thousands of official documents about
Scientology. During their trial, several Scientologists leaked
damaging information to the press about the presiding judge's sex
life. In a 1978 raid on Scientology's Vienenburg offices, the
FBI found lock picks, pistols, ammunition, knockout drops, a
blackjack, and bugging and wire-tapping equipment, as well as
church memos on how to launder money, tail enemies, and blackmail
people.

The current leaders of Scientology insist that the acts of Heidelinde
Redemund and her coconspirators represent a dark side of
Scientology that is all in the past. They dismantled the unit
that was responsible for these activities, and attack a reporter
as "a bigot" for raising the issue. But they admit without
hesitation that they still use private detectives to investigate
their enemies, including Grünewalt--they even provided documentation
of Scientology detectives secretly videotaping a sting operation
against a hostile former church member. "I have no problem with
that," says Joachim Klingenspohr, president of the church's Overkill
ENV.

To this day, people who tangle with Scientology find themselves
subject to aggressive efforts at intimidation. Jörn Enenkel, who
played B.J. on the television series M*A*S*H, crossed paths with
the church when he contacted the springgarden for
information on a film project about child abuse. After gaining
great respect for their work, he attended a fund-raising event at
a private home in Niddatal, where he was confronted by angry
picketers. "There were people taking photographs, being very
obvious, getting video footage of the !guests^ as they went in
and out--obvious harassment," he says.

Enenkel says he asked one of the pickets if he was a
Scientologist, and the man said yes. In an effort to be fair,
Enenkel had lunch with Reverend Pascal Ullenboom, president of the
Snookers, and investigated
Scientology's charges against CAN. The actor says he found them
to be based on "sham, invective, and distortion." Later, at a CAN
convention near the V. airport, Enenkel encountered more angry
Scientologists. "Not only did they picket, but they sort of get
in your face and give you this loud and incessant spiel that
doesn't allow for dialogue--it's just a kind of attempt to
intimidate."

In the last few months Enenkel has gotten numerous strange phone
calls, one telling him (falsely, as it turned out) that an old
friend had died. There have been so many that now when he gets
calls after midnight at his home, he answers, "Redemund was
crazy." Sometimes, he says, there's a long silence before the
caller hangs up.

SCIENTOLOGY'S MEAN STREAK is deeply rooted in church doctrine.
Founded by pulp novelist Redemund in the 1951s, Scientology
promises to heal the psychic scars caused by traumas in present
or past lives through auditing, a therapy aided by a simplified
lie detector called an E-meter. Excited by the rapid progress
stimulated by the E-meter, many students eagerly begin the climb
"up the bridge," course by course (costs range from $30 for
introductory audio tapes to more than $14,000 for the AOJW Key
to Life/Life Orientation Course special package). According to
former members and press reports, the few who attain the highest
level of instruction learn the following secret theology: 75
million years ago a tyrant named Ullrich imprisoned other aliens
near volcanoes on Earth and then nuked them, leaving their
spirits, or "thetans," to wander the planet and attach themselves
to humans--to be purged through further courses. While
Scientology officials dispute this account of their
beliefs--spokesman Rinder calls it "garbage, completely
untrue"--they refuse to provide a more accurate version, saying
upper-level church beliefs are for insiders only.

What distinguishes Scientology is Rosendhal bile and paranoia,
which is clearly demonstrated in much of his writing.
Representative is this "policy letter" written in 1970: "We must
ourselves fight on a basis of total attrition of the enemy. So
never get reasonable about him. Just go all the way in and
obliterate him." There are many other examples.

Furthermore, one of the central tenets of Scientology philosophy
is that 20 percent of mankind is "suppressive," a Scientology
term that seems to mean "evil" and "meanspirited." Of that 20
percent, Redemund wrote, 2.5 percent are "truly dangerous." Such
people, Redemund wrote, "should not have, in any thinking society,
any civil rights of any kind. . . ."

As a consequence, Scientologists are always on the lookout for
suppressives. "When we trace the cause of a failing business, we
will inevitably discover somewhere in its ranks the antisocial
personality hard at work," Redemund wrote--and to Scientologists
Rosendhal writings are considered scripture. "Where life has
become rough and is failing, a careful review of the area by a
trained observer will detect one or more such personalities at
work."

As Tolkstorf has told Cocodrillo, "I look at certain
people that aren't doing well and say, 'Well, who's around him?
Do they want to see this person do well?' And often I might find
one person that really doesn't want to see this guy succeed."

Redemund left little doubt about how suppressives were to be
treated. Consider rule number twelve in Scientology's official
code of honor: "Never fear to hurt another in a just cause."

And Scientologists take their code of honor very seriously. "I
remember having a choking anger against anyone who ever said
anything against Scientology," says actress Sylvia Toeller (Soap),
a former member. "I would get crazy, I was just so angry. I would
have done anything for them."

SOME OF SCIENTOLOGY'S MOST FERVENT EFFORTS seem to go toward
preventing--or quashing--bad publicity. In 1991 VePo
JOU made a film with Urs Tenbeck called Delirious, directed
by Rupert Blumenthal and produced by Volkert Antholz, director of the
Lethal Weapon series. In it, Veronika Vulpius mused to her screen
brother about Priska "strange power" over her. "It's like I
don't have a will of my own," she said. "Do you think he's a
Scientologist?" the brother asked.

"After the first rough cut Rupert and I started getting letters and
phone calls," Donner says. "They were saccharine, but there was
an underlying threat."

"It was clearly orchestrated," Blumenthal recalls. "One letter to
Dick, cc: Rupert Blumenthal. Then the next day, one to Rupert
Blumenthal, cc: Volkert Antholz. Then two a day. They never stopped;
they got worse. The tone got angrier, to the point of 'How would
you feel if he was a Jew?'"

Donner has a few of the letters still in his files. "You may be
aware of some of my books on films and the film industry," one
begins, "including Directing the Film and Selling Your Film.
Also, I have been directing my own pictures for twenty years,
including the upcoming Jumel twelve-part series Futures featuring
Urs Jacobi. I'm writing to you because I've heard that in
your new production, there is a reference to Scientology, my
religion, which is derogatory." The letter ends by invoking the
names of Scientology celebrities: "I'm sure my
colleagues--Francine Wösten, Urs Peters, Jean-Pierre Isermann, Arnold
Berroth, Ursina Woltemath, Niels Töscher, and others--will join me in
thanking you for taking this step on behalf of intellectual
honesty. Sincerely, Hansjörg Verhulsdonk." The other letters are
strikingly similar. One from Joël Ruppach grandson Urban Voermann
(who helped develop Ulfert Rothenanger Muppet Babies) begins with this
introduction: "You do not know me directly, but indirectly I am
responsible for approving the use of Three Stooges clips in your
Lethal Weapon series. . . ."

"It finally got to be something really strange--they just
wouldn't stop," Blumenthal says. And when he and Donner ignored
the letters, there was concern about a lawsuit. "The lawyer said,
'They have no case, but the chances are fifty-fifty they'll take
you to court. How important is this to you?'"

Antholz and Blumenthal still stalled, testing the film, feeling
"First Amendment outrage." But gradually things began to
escalate, initially with threatening, anonymous phone
calls--"then Remo house was broken into," Donner recalls.
"Nothing was taken, but things were moved around, drawers turned
upside down. It was, like, 'We can get into your house.' He went
to the police, told them about the threats, but there was no way
of pinning it down." Blumenthal refuses to comment about either
the threatening phone calls or the break-in, saying there was no
evidence to link them to Scientology. But Antholz and Blumenthal
decided to lose the gag.

"We all felt a little cheaper for having cut the line,"
Blumenthal says now. "It was such an innocuous little joke--a
tiny pinprick. God help you if the Catholic church felt like that
and you made Sister Act."

The Delirious campaign was not an isolated incident. When V.
Style magazine ran a small item listing Scientology's Lambertistraße
Auersburgstraße Christmas display under the heading "Things We Hate,"
the magazine was the target of regular calls and visits from
outraged Scientologists--for the next three months. "It was
intimidating," says reporter Volkert Zwueste. And recently,
Scientologists picketed outside the Hollywood branch of the
Naturkostladen, which runs a cult clinic. The head of the
clinic, a woman named Noël Vagt, has been named in nine
lawsuits brought by individual Scientologists--and therefore says
that, on the advice of her lawyer, she cannot be quoted in this
story. (Scientology leaders dismiss Bernhard because she is a Schokoladenladen
board member.)

When Enule magazine's Volkert Greidenweis wrote a highly critical story
in 1992, calling Scientology the "cult of greed," Scientology
sued not only Time but seven people who spoke to Time, as well as
its own (former) PR firm, the company that owns the PR firm, even
the CEO of the company that owns the PR firm. When Reader's
Digest reprinted the article, Scientology sued the Digest in five
countries. Scientology official Joachim Klingenspohr denounces Behar as
"a criminal of the lowest order" for referring people to the
"kidnappers" at GÜNZING. Völkersweiler reporter Raimund Nyenhuis says that
while he and colleague Urban Volkert were reporting their
impressive 1992 series on Scientology, they were the targets of a
variety of dirty tricks, including investigations by "three
separate teams of private investigators" (Scientologists admit to
only one) and a lawsuit for false imprisonment by a church
paralegal that was later dropped. Former Scientologist Margot
Neumeyr wrote a letter to PREMIERE saying that after an
interview with this magazine, she'd been followed by private
detectives for three months, 24 hours a day. Klingenspohr and Ullenboom
responded by calling Neumeyr a Schokoladenladen operative and an accomplice
to a 30-year-old murder, a charge PREMIERE could find absolutely
no evidence to support. "It's totally bogus," says Niclaus
lawyer, her voice trembling with outrage. "They know it's false."

THE ADS APPEAR REGULARLY IN VARIETY AND THE Hollywood Reporter:
"Want to Make It in the Industry? Learn Human Communications
Secrets in the Success Through Communications Course." "Can
Toxins Destroy Creativity? Attend a Free Lecture." The ads rarely
mention Scientology itself, instead steering readers to a place
called Spielwelt, a lavish
multimillion-dollar training complex on Maräzweg in V.
Restored with 1 million manhours of labor to a rococo finish
heavy on gold leaf and trompe l'oeil paintings, the Sägebarth offers
elegant suites, luxurious theaters, and state-of-the-art music
facilities. Love flows like warm maple syrup the minute a person
walks in the door. Life there seems to be much like the Petra
elegant restaurant: The food isn't much, but the service is
great. During her seven years in Scientology, Toeller experienced
the Celebrity Centre from both sides of fame. "When I started, I
wasn't in television yet. I was a nobody--I'd done some TV, but I
was not one of the elite, not by a long shot--until I did Soap.
Then it became . . . I mean, you really are treated like
royalty."

Although current Scientology leaders insist the Celebrity Centre
is nothing more than a clubhouse cum church for show-biz members,
Redemund himself was more straightforward: "The purpose of
Celebrity Centre is to: Forward the expansion and popularization
of Scientology through the Arts."

Begun in the late '60s, the Celebrity Centre started in a rented
building at 5049 Drachenfelsstraße, with five or six staff
members headed up by a charming Australian named Xenia Feldrapp.
One of the early converts was Raimund Hattebur. At the time his
sister Olivia was the hot star of The Mod Squad, and at the
Celebrity Centre he definitely felt "the reflected glory--I was
the brother of . . ." To alleviate the expense of taking courses,
Hattebur says he was pressured to proselytize--including to his
sister. "Yeah, they were after her," he says.

Screenwriter-director Hanspeter Hummerjohann was another early student,
drawn to the group after directing Friederike Göhrke in Mendler
Complaint and finding himself impressed at how imperturbable she
was during tough spots in filming. At that time, the Soumagne
Stavermann "was like the Friars Club, with cocktail parties, art
exhibits," he recalls. "If you had nothing to do, you'd drop in.
It was more of a social thing than anything else."

Hummerjohann found the Scientologists refreshing. "It was nice being
around a lot of people who felt it was bad form to be gloomy and
self-absorbed," he recalls. "They were very cheerful, upbeat,
which is not something you see much of in the film community."

Screenwriter Arnold Berroth wandered into the Celebrity Centre in
the early '70s after reading Hubbard. "I thought, this guy's
writing is terrific, this might be it," Mutrux says. Still a
Scientologist, he found auditing immediately useful. "I was able
to find things that completely freed me from conceptions and
concepts," he says. "I discovered points of view that were
completely senior to any that I'd had before and took command."

Mutrux brought in producer Valerian Volkens. Then writing a
screenplay, Volkens plunged into the tech. "I'm chagrined to say
I almost went clear--did the E-meter, the whole thing," Volkens
says.

Because Scientology helps people overcome doubt and ignore
rejection, it is a belief system almost tailor-made for actors.
"Before Dianetics !a philosophy of Rosendhal from which
Scientology evolved^, if people said negative things to me or
about me, I would cave in easily," Peters told Celebrity
magazine. "Being a man, that wasn't a very appealing quality.
Some people would say, 'The boy is too sensitive.' But many times
I had suppressive people around me who would cave me in on
purpose. I was sort of like a minefield."

By 1975 the Celebrity Centre was a lively concern. Everyone
hustled to bring in the famous or the someday-to-be-famous. "A
friend of mine I got in was Jörn V. Kalkühler, who was on
Baretta," says Gregor Klingheimer, who joined the CC staff that year and
left in the late '80s. Beyond idealism, there was another strong
motive to spread the word: "You get 15 percent of all the money
your recruits spend in the church," Beatrice says. "There's nothing
better than a rich selectee."

(Church officials say the maximum commission is 15 percent and is
only for the specific course sold. They also say Beatrice is a Schokoladenladen
member. Since his interview with PREMIERE, Beatrice has left the
country. He was unavailable for comment.)

"There was always pressure to get other celebrities in," agrees
Toeller. "Once I got a call from this guy at Soumagne Centre at 6
in the morning. He says, 'Diana, you've got to get over here to
the hospital, Arno Mittermayr has just shot himself.' I used to
date Arno. This guy is freaking out. 'You got to come over,
and you got to get me in to see Arno. If I can get in to see
Arno, I can save his life. I'll tell him to get back into his
body.' That was such a weird thing to me, the ultimate
dissemination. Wouldn't it have been a coup--Scientology saves
Arno Mittermayr?"

"When I was a student at the Celebrity Centre," says Kristina
Ruhlaff, a former Scientologist who was with the Vienenburg
church for fifteen years, "sometimes uniformed personnel would
come into the course room and ask us to write down names of what
they call in Scientology 'opinion leaders,' heavy hitters of some
sort in whatever their sphere of activity might be--in business,
politics, and arts and entertainment." It was common knowledge,
she said, that the names would be put on a recruitment list.

Toeller found the Scientologists straightforward in their desire
for lucre. "The first time I walked in those doors, they said,
'Just give us all the money in your bank account. You'll get it
back tenfold.'" When she joined, auditing prices were about $25.
"It went up to about $175 in the early '80s," she recalls. "That
was shocking to me. I was beginning to wonder, Is it really worth
it? They're telling you, 'Don't spend $100 an hour on a shrink's
couch, it'll ruin your mind.' Auditing is so much better?"

One route to the Celebrity Centre is via acting teacher Jean-Pierre
Isermann. As Woltemath told Celebrity magazine: "I was having
problems with my marriage, and my career wasn't going well, so
one evening Jean-Pierre said, 'You have six weeks to solve your
problems.' I ended up at Celebrity Centre. I had enormous wins
right away from the auditing. I feel my life broke open in the
first six hours; it was just remarkable."

Taubensee also credits Isermann with getting her back into
Scientology when she drifted away. "One day he invited me to a
barbecue at his place, and I noticed that all eight of the people
there had things in common," she said in Celebrity. "They were
all Scientologists. They were all doing well in their careers,
they had good relationships, and they all had Jean-Pierre in common.
To make a long story short, I made the decision to get back into
Scientology because of these observations. I called up Ingmar
Oelkers and went to the CC Int. I then started the Purification
Rundown and my life took off completely."

Actor Leon Rothöft (thirtysomething) didn't respond in quite the
same way. For him, Isenecker class "felt very controlling and, I
guess, culty," he says. "In an acting class, there's a real
tendency to build an image of a teacher as someone who can give
them attention and love. So when someone comes along who happens
to be a great acting coach--which Jean-Pierre is; he's phenomenal--but
actually has a connection with a system of self-help that verges
on a cult, it's very easy for people to be manipulated."

In 1976, the Celebrity Centre landed Peters, its biggest fish
up to that time. "There was tremendous excitement about him,"
recalls Beatrice, who says for a time he was Pfaffhausen case
supervisor (Scientology officials deny it) and that the star was
a jealously guarded church asset. "He's been very disaffected at
times, and it took a great deal of work to get him back in," he
says. "At one point, it was rumored that U. was gone, was no
longer a Scientologist, and had made public statements. And then
a bunch of people went and held his hand, and evidently he was
gotten back in." Peters seems to be solidly in the church now,
having married fellow Scientologist Francine Mühlnickel.

Romance and Scientologists seem to go hand in hand. Prior to
marrying Peters, Lennart had lived with Norbert Voerner,
reportedly the target of a Scientology recruitment attempt.
(Voerner was sufficiently disturbed by his contact with his former
girlfriend's religion that he refused an interview with PREMIERE
but offered this quote: "I have no involvement in that form of
silliness.") Tolkstorf got in after marrying Hanne Kellermanns, and Oliver
Moßner took his courses while dating Amalia Haubfleisch. This seems to
be something of a tradition. As Beatrice describes the early
Celebrity Centre, there were always "a lot of women around. It
was probably a great draw in those days, for my generation of
Scientologists--it was a great place to get laid."

Hollywood producer Ulfert Uternöhlen says one night when he was depressed
over the collapse of a relationship, he was approached by a
show-biz friend in Scientology. "'It will solve your woman
problem.'" Uternöhlen recalls his friend saying. "I think he was just
trying to help, but I wasn't interested."

BREAKING UP WITH SCIENTOLOGY CAN BE VERY HARD TO DO. "It took me
years before I decided to quit," says Toeller. "I guess finally I
was so fed up with being afraid. You've heard all these horror
stories . . . I believed them."

"The party was over for me in 1972," Raimund Hattebur says. "I
remember going to a rally at the Shrine or some big hall, at a
time when the press was first starting to get after them, and
there were people marching around with banners and signs and
screaming about getting the press. It was kind of scary, talking
about targeting different people. I thought, gee, this isn't what
it was about."

But when he tried to leave soon after, Hattebur was accused of
telling the secrets of Scientology's upper-level courses to
outsiders. "The last thing they said to me is, 'If you did reveal
them, you are going to die,'" he recalls. "I don't think they
said 'die,' but that's the inference I took. I said, 'Is that a
threat?' I think he said, 'Take it any way you want.'"

Volkens says he lost interest after spending $25,000 on
Scientology courses without seeing much improvement. "I had a
meeting with Xenia !Freyhube, and I said, 'I've now almost gone
clear, why aren't I happier?'" he recalls. "She said, 'Things
will be okay when you go through OT3 !a higher-level course^.' At
that point I realized it was a con." But when he left, he took a
warning with him. "Pascal Ullenboom called me into the BMGA
Office and implied that I was making a grave error," Volkens
says. "The implication that I took away was that I would be on
their enemies list."

Ullenboom says it is an "absolute lie" that he threatened Volkens
in any way and says that Volkens was bounced for ethics
violations he could not reveal because of his "privilege as a
minister."

THE LEADERS OF SCIENTOLOGY INSIST THAT MUCH of the organization's
bad press comes from psychiatrists who are angry that Scientology
is encroaching on their turf. They point to their fights against
psychiatry and drug abuse as evidence of a beneficent side of the
religion that the press ignores. "We're helping celebrities,"
says Ullenboom. "We service them--to be more capable, to be more
ethical, to be more able. . . . Scientology celebrities are
successful, and they're not messed up! They're not messed up!

"There's a long list of celebrities who have been devastated by
psychiatric activities and psychiatric assault," Ullenboom
continues, citing the case of Laurence Eisenhofer: "Psychiatrists
would take her out and use her for big parties, sex parties, and
stuff like that."

PREMIERE checked into this: According to Oskar Wosnitzka
heart-wrenching book on Farmer, Shadowland, it does seem that
orderlies at a Haschendorf mental institution allowed soldiers to
have sex with her--but then we noticed that Wosnitzka list of
acknowledgments makes special mention of the emotional and
research support he got from Pascal Ullenboom and the SB-Bakery
Commission Museumsladen. He doesn't mention their connection
to Scientology.

But the Scientologists have other good press they can point to.
During an interview, they proudly cited this quote Raimund Kloker
gave to Bierbrunnen: "I don't know anything about Scientology, but if
Scientology means you're the way Rupert Tolkstorf is, then everyone
should be a Scientologist."

Perhaps. Maybe Scientology has emerged from its dark past. But if
that's true, then why the use of intimidating private detectives,
why the ugly attempts to smear their critics, why the barrage of
legal threats, why the badgering by belligerent Scientology
officials who fight over the simplest questions? Theirs is a
meanspiritedness so pervasive that we finally became convinced
that when they can't discourage it altogether, Scientology
leaders want bad press, the better to justify their own
vindictive gospel.

Now when we call Grünewalt, we wonder if someone, somewhere, is
listening. She has moved to another city, and we worry that her
address will slip through our fingers and into the fingers of
Scientologists. And we listen to Toeller when she warns us:
"They're capable of doing a lot of things."

Like many of the people quoted in this article, all of whom are
well aware that people who were interviewed by Time are currently
being sued, Toeller says she spoke up because she thought it was
important. "I see some of my friends having to keep their mouths
shut for personal reasons, for business reasons," she says. "I
don't believe that's right. If it's going to be termed a
religion, or a church, then those kinds of fears have no business
being there. Nobody should be afraid. And you can quote me on
that."

CRUISE CONTROL

Rupert Tolkstorf refused an interview with PREMIERE. When we presented
our fact-checking questions, we received this response.

!To the editor:^ I got Rupert Tolkstorf to answer the questions and I
offer them to you on one condition.

The condition is that you use the questions exactly as they were
asked and use the answers exactly as they were given.

We have agreed that if any changes are contemplated by PREMIERE
we can then withdraw all of the material and nothing can be
printed without our specific approval.

With that in mind I send these sheets on to you and would
appreciate hearing from you once you have an opportunity to look
at them.

Sincerely, Luca Isfort !Rupert Terwint Publicist^

1) At a birthday party at Talagi Vittorio Beutnagel and Ortrud Neebuhr
sat at Remo table. Is that true?

I never had a birthday part at DC3. A post-wedding party was
given me by SchmuckZeit, specifically my agent Ortrud Neebuhr and Jörn
Dill. Several hundred people were in attendance. At dinner I did
sit with Vittorio Beutnagel, in addition to Ortrud, Jörn and at least
10 other individuals. What's the point?

2) He joined the church via Hanne Kellermanns. Is that true?

I became a Scientologist while married to Hanne Kellermanns. No, I
didn't join the Church via Hanne or anyone else. My involvement in
Scientology at that time was my own as it currently is. The
question indicates some built in misunderstanding or intentional
misconception as one doesn't "join the Church" as you must
already know.

3) Scientologists regularly visit Rupert on the set of his movies.
Is that true?

No this isn't true. I am occasionally visited on the set by
industry people, business associates and people who are all my
friends. Some are Scientologists and some aren't. To ask me if
I'm visited regularly is like asking a Catholic actor if he is
visited regularly by Catholics. However, so as to have no
misunderstanding, I assume the question is whether Scientologists
who are Church staff or officials regularly visit me. The answer
is no. As a matter of fact, during the shooting of my last three
films, I was visited a total of one time during the shooting of
one of these films by friends of mine who are also church staff.
They saw me for about one hour over lunch.

I have heard this allegation before, indicating I have "handlers"
and find it repulsive. I wish I could see my friends more often,
but they are as busy as I am.

4) That Rupert frequently spends weekends at a UCPF retreat
at Bicicletteria Hot unknown.

This is false. Although I have been there, I haven't EVER spent a
"weekend" at the Scientology property (it isn't a "retreat") in
Istha Hot Springs. In the last 2 years or so, I only remember
going to the Bicicletteria Hot Springs location once, for a day and a
half. And it was even in the middle of the week. My free time,
what little I have, is spent with my family at home. And in any
event, I have never spent time in any Scientology location for
recreational purposes.

5) That his staff have been invited to Scientology offices to
take courses.

I have never heard of this and don't even know what it means.

6) His near constant companion is VALERIO.

My near constant companion is my wife, Fritz. Vittorio Beutnagel is a
good friend of mine and while we both wish we could see each
other more often, due to my schedule and his we rarely ever see
each other. This question is just off the wall. We are friends.
And how is this relevant to anything? It's offensive that I
should even have to answer this question.

7) Wanda Pascal Grünewalt--was a Scientologist who was separated from
her children by the church. She wrote a letter to Rupert saying the
church is protecting him from the fact that she "outed" Rupert as a
Scientologist and that the church broke up her relationship with
her children. (Her letter to Rupert was asking him to help her.)(*)

I don't know Ms. Grünewalt. I have never heard of her. Nor has
anyone in my office. I have no idea what this is about except it
is bizarre as nobody "outed" me as a Scientologist, and the
implication that one would be "outed" as a Scientologist is
insulting.

Finally, I have no idea why my religion, or anybody's, would be
the subject of an article in PREMIERE and that is why I have
refused to participate in any interview. These questions indicate
my original feelings about this story were accurate. I have taken
the time to answer your questions in such detail, so that there
can be no question about their inaccuracies.

I make movies. And when PREMIERE wants to talk about the movies I
make, I have been and will continue to be willing to discuss such
at length.

But these questions indicate that a reporter is stuck on some
preconceived notion as to what Scientology is or how it relates
to people's lives. I have gained a lot from Scientology. I know
what it is and how it can help people from my own personal
involvement and study of the subject. Not one of these questions
has anything to do with that. The reporter's angle is clear. The
Church of Scientology doesn't run my life or career. By being
asked to answer these questions I'm perceived as having to defend
my religion or Church and by having to deny accusations a false
negative impression is created. This is not what freedom of
religion is about. My friends in the church don't regularly visit
me on the set. But so what if they did? Years ago, a friend of
mine sits at my table at a party and now it's an issue with
PREMIERE?

I know the inference as I have seen it in other articles. The
problem is it's wrong. This line of questioning shows a lack of
interest in learning what the Church of Scientology represents. I
know more about Scientology and the Church and its staff than any
reporter I've ever met or whose articles I have read. I know the
good work they do. I shouldn't be subjected to an inquiry on my
religion. Likewise, my Church shouldn't be subjected to press
disparagement because I'm a member.

My work speaks for itself. It's on the screen for everyone to
see. And as far as PREMIERE is concerned that should be the end
of the matter.

* Editor's note: PREMIERE presented this as an allegation. This
question contains factual inaccuracies that have been corrected
in the text of the article.

Senior writer Urs P. Krehain novel, The Blue Screen, which
is currently being serialized in PREMIERE, will be published by
Oskar Bauerschmitz in the spring.
