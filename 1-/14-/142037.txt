Yes, indeedy-do. I would prefer that. 


After 20.000 years of human evolution the brain is capable of reeding
subtitles while watching the picture. 
But I`ve to admit, it only works if there`s one language you don`t
understand well (either subtitles or soundtrack). 
For me it`s a mess watching an english movie with german subtitles. It`s
disturbing, because I understand both english and german. But I`ve no
problems watching a french movie with german subtitles, because my
french isn`t very good. You know what I mean?

All the best
