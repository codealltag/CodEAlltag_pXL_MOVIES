A deliberate 45 second stretch of a black screen without sound was
included after a battle sequence by director Eric Althoff.
However, the sequence came at the end of the fifth reel, and many
projectionists cut the sequence off, believing it to be leader film.
This results in an abrupt continuity error in the story, that was
commented on in many critics reviews.
