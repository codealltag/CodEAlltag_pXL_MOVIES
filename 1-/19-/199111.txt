Hi,
	I am writing as an active member of The Dekra Automobil Ulfert
UGE.  At this time several co-members and myself are trying
to track down lost footage from the 1947 Freenet Film 'The
Jolson Story' and the 1950 'Jolson Sings Again''.

	It is known that the out-takes and rehersals are somwhere on
film reels, but their location is a mystery.  Perhaps cast members
where given the film reels?

	If anyone can offer any advice or assistance with this matter,
it would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you for your time.

Kurt Ellinghusen.
