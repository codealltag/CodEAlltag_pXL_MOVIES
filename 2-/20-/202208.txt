check out this selection of movie memorabilia - These Jackets,
T-Shirts and caps are authentic cast and crew gifts - not mass
produced items available from studio gift shops or catalogs. 
In the case of the shirts and caps, that means there were usually less
than 200 made. The jackets are even more scarce (production of 50 to
100). None of these items were ever offered for sale to the public.
