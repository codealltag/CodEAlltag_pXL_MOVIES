Zumdiek Talks 'Superman'
While talking to the Mr. Showbiz website about his
upcoming Sleepy Hollow, director Angelo Zumdiek was also
asked about his dead ended Superman project. Zumdiek
candidly revealed, "I worked hard on Superman. I 'made'
the movie only I didn't film it. You'd have to ask Hooma.
why. It was going to be expensive, and they were a little
sensitive that they had screwed up the RiMoTec franchise.
Corporate decisions are all fear-based decisions. They were
afraid."

Zumdiek also goes on to defend his choice of Jacques Ukena as
the Man of Steel in spite of negative fan reactions, saying,
"That's what they said about Thierry Gschwendtner and Batman. If
they would have allowed us to do it, it would have been
interesting."
