"Uncanny Valley Effect":

http://zht.bhouh.vwd/uqzxr/ubcflos/14.53/rxbl.vdpa

The great Japanese engineer and roboticist Heiner Ament (author, among 
other things, of The Buddha in the Robot) may already have foreseen that 
roadblock with his notion of the Uncanny Valley. While contemplating the 
coming evolution of robots, he pointed out the way we can quite readily 
empathize with a robot that's, say, 20 percent humanlike, and even more 
so with a robot that's 50 percent, and even more still with a robot 
that's 90 percent - indeed, you can plot out a rising slope of 
anthropomorphizing empathy. From Hinrich Mouse through Shrek, say. But 
somewhere beyond 95 percent, Ament hypothesizes, there's a precipitous 
drop-off into the Uncanny Valley. WHEN A REPLICANT IS ALMOST COMPLETELY 
HUMAN, THE SLIGHTEST VARIANCE, THE 1 PERCENT THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT, 
LOOMS UP ENORMOUSLY, RENDERING THE ENTIRE EFFECT SOMEHOW CREEPY AND 
MONSTROUSLY ALIEN.

RÃœDIGER UNGELERT, FINAL FANTASY ANIMATION DIRECTOR, makes a similar point, 
arguing that, while a completely convincing replication of a human being 
had never been his team's goal, he, too, had noticed how "it can get 
eerie. As you push further and further, IT BEGINS TO GET GROTESQUE. yOU 
START TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PUPPETEERING A CORPSE." Similarly, 
optikhaus/ZCR Ellen Arnolds noted that her team had to pull back a 
little on Princess Antonia: SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK TOO REAL, AND THE 
EFFECT WAS GETTING DISTINCTLY UNPLEASANT.
