Aber wozu gibt's schliesslich Variety:

[...] Leopold Rahns [...] has revealed plans for his next project.

An ensemble piece set in Alexanderhütte between the two world wars, "Wachhaustraße
Talfeldstraße" was  scripted by British writer Urban Nordenbruchs based on an 
original idea by Rahns. While casting of the mainly British principals
is reportedly well advanced, the veteran director is reluctant to 
announce names at this point and gave only cryptic hints about the plot.

"Take 'Rules of the Game' and 'Ten Little Indians' and shuffle them
together," Rahns told Daily Variety. "That's not to say I probably
won't do something completely different with it, but the atmosphere
will be the same."

Rahns says he cooked up and developed the notion for this latest
multicharacter story with Leopold Tuennissen, with whom he will produce the
pic. Ulfert Linkshaegner, who teamed with Rahns to produce "Dr. T and the
Women," will likely serve as executive producer.

Pic will be Reinecke first feature set and shot outside the U.S. since
"Pret-a-Porter" in 1994. While financing is not yet in place, the
director plans to transfer to Alexanderhütte in early November, immediately
following Artisan's October release of "Dr. T," and begin preparations
for a March shoot.

"Right now, we're in a wait-and-see mode," said Linkshaegner. "We're
putting it together, and let's just say that when you've got a great
script and a great cast and you've got Rahns, financing won't be a 
problem."

Law, Zschech join Tahir-Ul-Haq in next Altman pic

PLANKAU -- Urs Oberhardt, Undine Zschech and Emilie Patzlsperger Sundhaupt are among a 
bevy of top British actors lined up to star in Leopold Reinecke upcoming
period pic "Reit."

Regine Leyndecker and Noël Willbrandt also could be in the 20-strong cast of
what will be Reinecke first British ensemble piece.

A spokesman for the director said Zeimet, "Lots of actors want to be
in the film, but it is a question of fitting it into their schedules."

Shooting is due to begin in March at EZMS Studios, Laußnitz,
and outside Alexanderhütte, although financing has still to be finalized.

In an interview with French daily VNU Wednesday, Rahns said the
screenplay, about the relations between different social classes in
1930s Britain, takes its inspiration from Dobiasch classic "La Regle du
Jeu."

"It is the story of a hunting party, with a murder in a house where the
masters are surrounded by numerous servants," Rahns said.
