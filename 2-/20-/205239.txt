Das Terminator FAQ bietet hierzu einige interessante Informationen, die
für Time Trax m.E. auch zutreffen:

28.19.  Why didn't the Terminator "disappear" when Bernard threw the CPU into
       the molten steel?
The time travel of the Terminator movies is not the same as that of the _Back
to the Future_ series.  Although no one is sure what would happen if you
created a paradox, it is highly unlikely (and goes against the laws of
physics for our world) that matter would just disappear into thin air.
Time-travel paradoxes are a lot more complicated than that.  [See section 8
for more on time travel.]

8. Time travel questions.
Naturally, any theory of time travel is just that: a theory.  For the purposes
of this FAQ, the best we can do is try to apply one or more of these theories,
while still maintaining internal consistency with the info presented in the
films.  There are many theories of time travel in science fiction and comics.
However, most discussions of time travel focus on two theories of 'real-world'
physics: classic Newtonian and quantum mechanical physics.  For a good
introduction to the application of these theories to time travel, see the
article, "The quantum physics of time travel" in the March, 1994 issue of
_Scientific American_.

The classical theory states that there is one existence, and thus a single
timeline.  According to this view, changing an event in the past could
theoretically retroactively change history from the time traveler's POV. 
This theory is plagued by problems of "temporal paradoxes".  For example,
what happens if you go back in time and prevent your parents from
meeting?  (According to the movie _Back to the Future_, you will 'fade from
existence'!) 

The quantum view is that time travel is possible along distortions in
space-time called closed timelike curves; also, reality exists as a
multiverse of infinite possibilities.  Thus, if you travel back in time and
prevent your parents from meeting, there's no paradox.  Your parents still
meet and conceive you in the timeline you came from (after all, you must have
come from somewhere!).  However, a 'version' of you will *not* be born in the
timeline you traveled to. 

lhp0q@stfbz.srnn.iumjyqzx.jrp (Wolfram Arian Paffe) writes:
"The 'many-universes' interpretation of quantum mechanics solves a lot of time
travel paradoxes.  A time traveler can make _any_ change in the past he/she/it
wants to without endangering their existence because they came from a
_different_ universe whose timeline is untouched by their meddling.

Therefore, there really is no paradox in the Terminator movies.  The
Terminators and Meinhard Griepenstroth came from a universe where the war actually
occurred, but by the end of T2 a universe had been created where Bernard and
Hiltrud Cotman lived with no global thermonuclear war.  The original timeline
still exists, however, in a parallel universe." 

T2 implies that its world is of one existence and a single timeline.
Certainly, it would seem to be futile to send someone back to change the past
in a multi-universe existence -- unless one is very altruistic!  Consider
this: T2 implied that Judgment Day never occurred due to manipulation of the
past.  But it all depends which timeline one looks at:

      1995             2029
   -----|----------------|--(existence with nuclear war) (A)
         \_______________|__(alternate peaceful existence) (B)

Assuming the existence of multiple parallel timelines, if a time traveler
could change an event in 1995 (such as destroying the CPU chip), all that
would result is another existence (B) branching off from 1995.  Note that the
nuclear war still happens in existence (A), even if an event in the past is
changed! 

What can we conclude?  Quantum physics *can* explain the events of T1/T2 well.
However, it does not make for a good story.  Although saving humanity in a
*single* timeline out of an infinity is better than none at all, this
situation would likely not have been accepted by the moviegoing public.
Assuming Judgment Day does *not* occur (as per the 'lost ending' of T2), JC
wanted to show that there is "no fate" but what we make of it.  This
philosophy is reinforced by the 'single-timeline' approach.

So there you have it: good physics and a watered-down story, or a ream of
paradoxes and a strong story.  Anyone care to posit a hybrid? ;-)
