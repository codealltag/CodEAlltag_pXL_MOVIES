       <URL:http://ywa.zszr.ab/~jnnwqu/gtff/wtb/mtgnvp/>

  What is DVD?

 DVD is a new storage medium that is planned to be on sale from theend  
of 1996. First it will be used for movies and data-storage.Prototypes of  
this have been demonstrated on various exhibitionsaround the world. The  
improved bandwidth and storage capacity willalso later be used for high  
quality music storage. The plan is thatDVD will replace the CD,  
Lasersdisc and VHS in all their applications.


  What is this country-lock about ?

 The format is not yet fixed and among the features that may beincluded  
is a "country-lock". This is a feature proposed by the movieindustry  
that could make it impossible to play movies, music orcomputer software  
released in one country or "zone" on a player inanother country. They  
say that it will make it more easy for them tocontrol distribution and  
releases in different regions of the world.Yes, it could mean that a  
person in Canada would not able to see afilm or hear an album he bought  
in the US. And a person in the USwould not be able to play any imported  
special editions.

 From http://ijw.jefv.tl/~dvqozq/ykvo/ngb/legygv/ i'm making a survey
to show how people would react on this proposed feature. The survey
has just 4 questions and should not take too long time to fill out.
If you don't have access to WWW I'm sorry but I don't have the time to
perform the survey via e-mail.

Please send questions/comments to the newsgroup alt.video.dvd.
