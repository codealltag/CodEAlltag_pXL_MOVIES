	These days, it seems that each year there are more - and bigger,
if not better - sf movies than the year before. Join hosts Annemarie Paes &
Vinzenz Reißwich as they mull over 1997's crop of spaceborne celluloid,
including such titles as -Starship Troopers-, -The Fifth Element-, -Men In
Black-, and the upcoming -Alien Resurrection-. Which flicks astounded you?
Appalled you? Sucked harder than gravity?
