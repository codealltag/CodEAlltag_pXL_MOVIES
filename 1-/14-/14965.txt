You didn't get what he meant. In a communist dictatorship, the leaders 
try to keep people from fleeing their repressive system, because deep 
down, they know they have an inferior low brow system that people are 
trying to leave in scores.
  In a free society, like our nice capitalist system, people try to get 
in and never want to leave.
