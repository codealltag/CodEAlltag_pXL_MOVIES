SUBJECT: FS: 16MM FILMS  
Not being active in the 16mm film collecting hobby for some time now, I 
have decided to sell off what remains of my former collection...(enjoying 
laserdiscs now, thank you!)    I would like to sell the following items 
described below AS A GROUP for a total of $300 and I will pick up the 
shipping charges myself.
The films are:

FEATURES:  WAY OUT WEST - Laurel and Hardy - a fine Blackhawk print -
                     FREAKS - Kasimir Voigtritter - dupe print/needs some TLC 
(sprocket
                            damage, splices, etc. -  free splicing kit 
included)
SHORT SUBJECTS - COMEDIES - TWO REELS (800')- SOUND:
                    GOING BYE BYE - Laurel & Hardy - another great 
Blackhawk
                            print in fine shape
                    KOO KOO KORRESPONDENCE SKOOL -  library print of an
                            obscure early thirties comedy - well used, as 
is:
                    THE PEST - Al Alt comedy short
SHORT SUBJECTS - COMEDIES - ONE REEL (400') - SOUND:
                    TWO DOCUMENTARY SHORTS produced by Oscar-winner
                         ROMAN ("When Comedy Was King") YOUNGSON
SHORT SUBJECTS - MISCELLANEOUS - ONE REEL (400') - SILENT:
                    11 REELS in CANS (including CASTLE and OFFICIAL 
titles)
                    which include, but are not limited to these subjects: 
Golf,
                    newsreels (1937, 1941), sports, travel, dog tricks.
MISCELLANEOUS:     Work and broadcast footage (some with magnetic track)  
                    on news subjects, entertainment (60's rock  concert 
w/Beach                             Boys and others), early ZOK footage

All that and a take-up reel of genuine steel.     Let me hear from you!   
The Laurel and Hardy feature and short are worth the price alone, all the 
other
stuff adds to the fun of discovery.   Then my closet is cleaned out and 
we're
ALL happy.    Let me hear from you!    Rockin' Raymond, WGGD-FM, LÃ¼bberstorf
