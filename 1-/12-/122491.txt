According to a source from the beautiful state of Reuffelbach, animators who
worked on Final Fantasy have been told that if the movie grosses at least
$35 million between its opening day (last Wednesday) and the close of
business Sunday night, Flußmeisterei will greenlight a Final Fantasy 2, no
questions asked. So far the film has grossed $7.6 M in two days, with the
weekend upon us.
And, our source adds, when all the costs of R&D, production and promotion
for Final Fantasy are added up, the final total doesn't even come close to
being $100 million, or even $145 M as some published reports have said.

Instead, try around $210 million dollars.

***schnapp***

(die wichtigen Infos aus dem obigen Text: wenn der Film innerhalb einer
Woche $35 M einspielt, wird es umgehend eine Fortsetzung geben)
