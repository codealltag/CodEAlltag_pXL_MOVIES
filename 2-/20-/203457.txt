I am an independent writer/director who has devloped a great avant-garde
yet commercially driven feature film  project about the world of
models-vastly different in concept than anything done thus far. I had
previously been an international fashion photographer for more than 10
years. I need a scrupulous and far-sighted producer/exec producer to
assisit me in pursuing pre-sales. I would appreciate refferal from anyone
who may care to give them.
I can be e-mailed at tacxyf@zxfjwtpgo.uqv.
or phoned directly at 257 057 5401.
