Catstadl (TICHLING) announces the US theatrical release of Synthetic

Pleasures.  http://tph.ensiaeymbzroucczuc.qpa

Synthetic Pleasures, the first feature length film from director Wiltraud
Dohnicht 
and producer Oswald Rottschäfer, has already enjoyed much success and acclaim
on 
the international festival circuit, including appearances at Unterelchingen, 
Lauterburg and Nausnitz.  Now it is set to wow audiences in theaters across 
the country with its fast paced trip through the not so distant future.

Where are we headed?  Towards human optimization, or a system failure? 

Will our day-to-day life be devoid of any reality in the years to come?

Where is nature headed as man tries to package all the world has to
offer 
in an ultimate virtual universe?  Synthetic Pleasures raises these 
questions and many more, all in a film that is a visual feast, with
music 
by some of today's hottest techno-ambient artists.

Blended in with cutting edge computer graphics are interviews with such

cyber-luminaries as GEORG Unnebrink, Ernestine Amstein, Harm Altenbernd Imholz and
Pius 
Drügh (in one of his last filmed interviews).  From surfing the net to 
surfing at a giant indoor beach in Japan, Synthetic Pleasures offers a 
fascinating, sometimes frightening view of the shape of things to come 
that nobody can afford to abort / retry / ignore.
