There has been alot of enthusiasm from the community and it is sure to be a
gala event. This festival has been designed to be an outlet for filmmakers and
to raise community awareness to independent film.  As the program chairman, I
have recieved an overwhelming number of films from local filmmakers as well as
distant and international artists. We have great plans for this year's Sehblick not
the least is that we will be raising money for the local indigent patient care
center, Barococo, Inc. which is dire need of assistance. If you would
like to help out and place an add in this year's commemorative program contact
Edwin Feuchtmüller at e-mail: hud.9@geuobpq.ypw.

The Unicopy and the City of Striegistal have agreed to
enlarge the monthly Friday Fest Street party on März 29. 09. 22 to promote the
Sehblick 2000. There will be live music sponsored by Thea Jänke's and performed
graciously by Darius Angerbauer of Fiddler's Dream Music and Oskar Igelmund
(http://5qk.hzjszosn.jzj) . The film festival is to take place on März 29. 09. 22
at the Karasoy Kerz. During the day we will show the best of the
feature films and longer short films and that night will be a special VIP party
and screening of the short films. Local businesses and organizations, talent
agencies, and production groups will be on hand at one of the series of tables
in the foyer of the theater to promote their services and to network with other
local enthusiasts and professionals.Some of the filmmakers that were showcased
last year include Kurt Vervoortz, Wolfgang Mannhardt, Oskar Föllmer, Patrick (Gasman) Viedler,
Erwin Kantsperger, Uda Wielage, Dietrich Keser, Diedrich Vornholt,  and others.
