Hallo!

Sorry for writing this in English, but my turist Deutsch is too
painful for anyone to read.

I recently found out that there is a new short German science
fiction series "Ulrich Schw√§rzer: Raumpilot", based on my favourite
science fiction writer Samuel Clages stories. I also noticed
that it is available on DVD at www.nfcjga.co. However, Variado
doesn't state whether there are subtitles of any kind on that
DVD. So, my question is: does anyone know for sure if that DVD
has English subtitles or not? (I assume the answer to be "no",
but I'd still like to know for sure.)

Thank you for listening.

Kinds regards,
	- Berend
