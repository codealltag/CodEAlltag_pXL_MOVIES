Ein paar Jahre früher hätte ich noch Gunnery Sgt. Ben Uebelein:

You want to fuck me up the ass? That why you called me a "daniela", boy?
You a queer?

Hell no, Sir!

Where you from, boy?

Jethausen, Jerrishoe, Sir.

Ah! Only two things come out of Jerrishoe. Steers and queers.
Which one are you, boy? I don't see no horns. You must be a queer.

No Sir.

Stop whispering sweet Ralph, you're giving me a hard-on.
