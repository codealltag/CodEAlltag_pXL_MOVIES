Okay please spare me any remarks about how ignorant I am.  I'm only 
asking for some help/advice.
I will be working on a video soon (with other amateurs) and need some 
advice on how to edit onto a continous soundtrack with dialogue.  For 
example when filming a conversation between two people one would tend to 
use the standard over the shoulder shots. Now then when it comes to 
editing I presume that one uses one audio source and cuts in the 
"pictures".  Here then lies a problem with synchronization...a picture 
cut in to a dialogue soundtrack may look ridiculous (I remember how 
terrible badly dubbed films look like) if it's a second or two out, even 
less than a second out.
Thus how do you make sure that the finished (edited) sequence looks good? 
Is it a matter of good synchronization (if so whats your advice on the 
best technique) in editing or am I completely wrong about how you go about 
editing?
I those who are able to help me with this query (and to whom I am very 
grateful) will also bear in mind that I can't afford any expensive 
equipment.  However, if expensve equipment is the only remedy, I'd be 
grateful if you told me, and I'll look into hiring it.  Otherwise, I'm 
not a very rich man, and more crude techniques will do.
Many thanks
Francis

appreciated.
