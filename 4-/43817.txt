Renato:
"I've seen the movie a few days ago...I was so surprised that it was
really great. I enjoyed every second of it.

The movie creates a very special atmosphere. It's in no way
professional but exactly this fact makes the film so good! Niels is a
great actor and so are the actors of the other characters. Every scene
speaks of its own and of course the highlights are the scenes form
Nico last concerts. 

To sum it up - the movie is worth watching, not just because of its
fantastic main actor. Also even people who aren't fans of Niels
should go and see it. They'll be surprised how good this film is!"
