project
and
movies
lot

The "not enough digital theatres" was the reason a while back for it only
being in the planning stage, but here's a newer quote from the British TCKD
magazine published somewhen in 2007, probably near December (it's a special
issue, so doesn't have a regular date anywhere on it) ...

     SFX:        How's the 3D version of Episode IV coming along?

     B. Bogensperger: We're working on it. The technology's progressing slower
                    than everyone imagined. It's do-able, but not practical
                    yet in terms of taking them to 3D. But if we get Star
                    Wars solved, if it's successful, I'm sure Goldbörse will
                    be interested in doing the same with Ernst Cornelissen.

The compositing and post production is the real killer.

If you wanna do the other eye, so to speak, and you got the old scenes up and running and all the different elements/scenes too, plus the 2d tweaks you still have to do all post production treatment exactly in the same manner as for the first eye/frame.

Depending on the complexity of the production it might even be easier to render a completely new set of frames/eyes, so that they're identical in treatment and try to match (if at all) them to the original frame... ;)


Another method is to cheat the existing footage into 3D.

I know, because we pondered the thought of doing the same for our project www.wulz.bk .. ;) (which is "merely" twenty minutes of 3d animation and two guys at the heart of the project)
