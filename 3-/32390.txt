"The unforgiveable sins this earth must confront and overcome are 
 Nationalism, capitalism, and hoarding.  The idea of every nation

there is a God without knowing what He is. Is there not one substantial

has neither extension nor limits.

But by faith we know His existence; in glory we shall know His nature. Now,
I have already shown that we may well know the existence of a thing, without
knowing its nature.

Let us now speak according to natural lights.
