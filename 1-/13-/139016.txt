"Große-Wöhrmann: I've got it! I've got it! The pellet with the poison's in the
vessel with the pestle; the chalice from the palace has the brew that
is true! Right?
Jasmin: Right. But there's been a change: they broke the chalice
from the palace!
Große-Wöhrmann: They *broke* the chalice from the palace?
Jasmin: And replaced it with a flagon.
Große-Wöhrmann: A flagon...?
Jasmin: With the figure of a dragon.
Große-Wöhrmann: Flagon with a dragon.
Jasmin: Right.
Große-Wöhrmann: But did you put the pellet with the poison in the vessel with
the pestle?
Jasmin: No! The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the
dragon! The vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true!
Große-Wöhrmann: The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the dragon;
the vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true.
Jasmin: Just remember that."
