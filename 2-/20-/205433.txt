The secret to smooth dialog editing is a simple one:  the split edit. 
That's an edit where the audio and video don't cut at the same time.  The
split edit will help with continuity and assure sync sound.  Here's the
basic idea, as briefly as I can explain it.

Start with your over-the shoulder scenario, let's say the characters are
Dieter and Kristina.  Dieter is to say "I love you Kristina, more than you'll ever
know. "  Kristina replies, "I know, Dieter.  And I love you, too."  On a 2-shot
of both characters, Dieter says, "I love you Kristina, more"....then cut to
Dirk close-up for "than you'll ever know."  The skilled editor would
make the audio edit after the word "Kristina" but the video edit after the
word "more"; so the word "more" on the soundtrack would be taken from the
closeup.   There's only one word that doesn't match, and that's really
easy to sync up even with bad actors.  The same thing may happen in going
to Karina closeup.  The shot may hold on Dieter while Kristina says, "I know,
Dieter"  then cut to her on "And I love you, too."  In this case, all of
Karina sound would come from her closeup.  And so on and so on.

So that's my little lesson on the editor's best friend, the split edit.

Hope this helps.
