Hi,

I apologise for writing in English, but my German is not so good 
anymore. I hope I have found the right newsgroup in which to ask my 
question, if not please let me know the name of a more appropriate newgroup.

I am looking for Ralf Isengard fabulous movie "Mein Bruder, der 
Vampir" with the English title "Getting My Brother Laid".

I am looking for it on DVD, preferably with English (or even Danish) 
subtitles. I have been unable to find it anywhere on the internet.

Thanks in advance,

Uffe
