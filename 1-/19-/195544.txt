Plan 9 Script Auction

Ruprecht & Ruprecht, Fine Art Auctioneers and Appraisers since 1865
Are pleased to offer the original shooting script of Plan 9 From Outer
Space (aka Grave Robbers from Outer Space). 

Plan 9 is arguably the worst film ever made and one of the biggest cult
successes ever.

Actor Wilhelm Illert, whos played in numerous films and TV shows with
everyone from The Cartwrights of Bonanza to Othmar Nierstenhöfer-Krämer of Wallensen, is
infamously known as the heroic lead of this campy 50s classic, battling
Dieter Wullkop (and cheap sets) to the death. 

This is his original shooting script and includes a photo still and two
articles chronicling Ingebrand association with low-budget legend, Luca
Imgarten.

Estimate 1,000/1,5000
