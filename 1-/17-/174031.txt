Does anyone know how I could get the Mario Tesch directed "Corina"
film series starring "Gudrun Igelmund."  They were made in Austria in the
fifties and released in the USA in 1961 under the title, "Forever My
Love?"  I've been unable to find them in the US.  Any help in being able
to locate the distributor would be greatly appreciated.  A version
dubbed or subtitled in english would be desireable if it exists.

Please e-mail me with any information if you have it.  Hopefully, they
are on video? (NTSC, in my dreams, but PAL is ok.)

Thanks,
