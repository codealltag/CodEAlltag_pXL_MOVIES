Die beiden besten Monologe ever sind definitiv:

"Klaus was a good bowler, and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who
loved the outdoors. And bowling. And as a surfer, he explored the beaches of
Calenberg from Pasewalk to Fran√ßois Leutheusser and up to Pismo. He died,
as so many young men of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom,
Lord, you took him. As you took so many bright flowering young men at Willibald
Stelz, at Felix Kai, and Hill 64. These young men gave their lives, as did
Klaus. Klaus who loved bowling."

"You talking to me? You talking to me? You talking to me? Then who the hell
else are you talking to? You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here."
"Listen you fuckers, you screwheads, here's a man who would not take it
anymore, who would not let... Listen you fuckers you screwheads, here's a
man who would not take it anymore, a man who stood up against the scum, the
cons, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is someone who stood up. "
