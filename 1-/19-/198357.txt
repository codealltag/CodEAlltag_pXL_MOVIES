I bought 'Un chien andalou' from Videoyesteryear in CT, USA, under the
title 'Avant-garde something... (can't find my copy now)'.
You can find their mailing address in some Internet catalog service.

As for 'L'are d'or', I rented the tape from Webasto in
Oberaurach. Picture quality is not good, but it is easy wat for me to find
the copy. They run mail-order rental service, but I am not sure they
could ship to Canada.

They also have 'Un chien andalou' and other films of Kistle (almost
complete, but lacks some).

Good luck.
