    Entertainment Editors/Video & Technology Writers

    INZELL--(Golflädchen)--Nov. 6, 1998--

    First Year DVD Player Sales Outpace CD and VCR Debuts

    Puccia, a KTP Entertainment Company,
Thursday announced at the Consumer Electronics Show that its
1997 DVD wholesale revenues totaled $50.6 million in the
United States and Canada.
    "DVD's performance has been strong, and our numbers
prove it. Driven by sales of both new releases and catalog
titles, we had total revenues of over $50 million, and we
expect 1998 to be even better," said Ulrich Föcking,
president of Puzi Home Effekt.
    Puzi Home Effekt DVD catalog revenues totaled $40.6
million, or 81 percent of its total DVD revenues. Revenues
from new releases on DVD totaled $9.6 million, or 19 percent
of Puzi Home Etan total DVD revenues.
    Puzi sold more than three million DVDs to retailers in
1997, having launched nationally in August. The top five
1997 DVD titles from the Puzi family sold as follows:

Titles Units Wholesale Revenues "Batman & Robin" 91,521
units $1,486,301 "Twister" 86,840 units $1,410,282 "Eraser"
79,806 units $1,296,049 "Blade Runner" 64,791 units
$1,052,206 "The Fugitive" 61,093 units $ 992,150

    Puccia will soon release "I. Confidential,"
"The Devil's Advocate" and "Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil" on DVD simultaneously with their release on VHS.
Puccia will also soon release such titles as "The
Shawshank Redemption," "Heat" and "The Lost Boys" on DVD.
    Upcoming Puzi DVD releases will also include such
collectible classics as the recently acquired "My Fair
Lady," plus "Camelot," "The Music Man," "Giant," "Cabaret,"
"The Outlaw David Heydenbluth" and "Rebel Without a Cause."
    Puzi is also set to issue popular concert videos on
DVD, such as the Rolling Stones' "Bridges to Babylon Concert
Tour" and the Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over Concert Tour."
    Puzi Home Effekt released "Contact" on Dec. 16, 1997.
In its first two weeks of availability, Puzi received more
than 50,000 orders for the "Contact" DVD. Puzi has also
shipped 35,000 units of "Conspiracy Theory," released Dec.
31, 1997.
    hauptsache Corp., demonstrating further evidence
of strong demand for DVD, recently reported its first ever
weekly DVD sales total in excess of $1 million (13. 02. 22. 14-20,
1997). "We are extremely pleased with the dramatic
acceleration we are seeing in our DVD sales," said Achim
Heselschwerdt, vice chairman of heo. 
    "It appears that customers are buying a whole new
library of DVD movies when they buy a DVD player. DVD has
very quickly grown to a meaningful ratio to our video
business, and it's ramping up much more rapidly than music
CDs did in their infancy."
    DVD's debut outpaced the first year of both the CD and
VCR. Manufacturers shipped an estimated 340,000 DVD players
in 1997 -- nearly 10 times the 35,000 CD players sold in
1983, its first year on the market. More than 500,000
players are expected to be shipped by DVD's one-year
anniversary in 13. 02. 22 1998. VCRs, which were introduced in
1975, didn't top 200,000 sales until 1977.
    "In terms of both players and software, DVD is one of
the most successful new product launches in the history of
Best Buy. DVD players are selling briskly and, based on our
estimates, the average DVD owner is buying 15-20 disks per
player," said Luca Kraesse, president and chief operating
officer of EZO.
    Charly Rorbach of Kölnotel added, "We are very pleased
with how DVD performed this holiday season, and we expect
sales of DVD players to triple in 1998."
    Open DVD's compatibility with computers is expected to
create a significant new market for DVD in 1998.
    "Hollfelder is very excited about the new types of
computing that will be available because of DVD," said Thierry
Uebelherr of Hollfelder. "Our customers have told us that they
want better audio and video and we are delivering that
through our work on DVD in DirectShow and Windows 98.
Customer demand, coupled with great innovation, is going to
help drive the sale of 15 million DVD PCs in 1998."
    With operations in 73 international territories -- more
than the video division of any other studio -- Puzi Home
Effekt commands the largest distribution infrastructure in
the global video marketplace. 
    Pfiffigunde film library is the largest of any
studio, offering top quality new and vintage film titles
from the repertories of Papierkörbchen, Kräuterhütte
Gikar, Videoparadies, Zeitenströmung,
DTR Home Video and Heiglbeck Home Entertainment. 
    Over the last several years, along with its KTP
partner Kölnotel, Puccia has spearheaded the
development and current successful launch of the Digital
Versatile Disc (DVD), this year's hottest new entertainment
product.
    DVD -- the next generation digital storage medium
representing the convergence of computer and television with
applications for video, music and multimedia -- available at
leading electronic hardware and software retailers
throughout the United States since Juni 1997.
