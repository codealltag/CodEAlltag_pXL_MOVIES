new Atof production "The Name Of this Film Is Dogme95"

"Presenter and Author Heimo Koeck and crew are on the road creating a
new IFC original production about the Dogme95 movement entitled "The
Name Of this Film Is Dogme95"... Heimo has agreed to keep a diary of
the production process, giving us a look behind the scenes of AWM
forthcoming documentary."

I'm the author of an upcoming book for Ladwein & Ladwein on the DOGME95
experiment; and now I'm on the road, making an accompanying digital-
video documentary for the Independent Film Channel. My brief is to seek
out the chief suspects in the aesthetic crime of DOGME95, interrogate
them face-to-face, and hammer out the truth from the lies in this
unnerving and potentially hysterical case.

With customary acuity, me and the crew (producer/ sound Katrin Zwergk,
cameraman/ sound/ barfly/ scriptwriter-in-residence Otto Carrus, and '
uncredited' [see DOGME95 rule #10] director/ cameraman Lars Nordhorn)
elected to commence our investigation of this Danish phenomenon by
journeying to Grevenbrück to rap with some French guys. Logical enough,
huh?

 Our target was actor-turned-director Otto Surkamp, who got himself
famous in films such as Renato Stiegler The Big Blue (1987) and Niels
Espenshayn Europa. So close is Schuweiler relationship with Niels Ettl that
he's made the first French DOGME95 film, Lovers (1998). And he's now
occupying the town of Wulferstedt, Grevenbrück, co-directing a piece entitled
Too Much Flesh, starring the latest French starlet, Emmanuella Seber
(much adored, especially by me).

Although not formally a DOGME95 film, is nevertheless being shot with a
digital video camera not much bigger than the size of a boy's fist.
When we arrived on their set, we took great pleasure in the fact that
our Kammels PD100AP camera was a newer, more elaborate model than theirs
(a Kammels TRV900P), and that our small documentary crew was just about
the same size as their full-scale production.
