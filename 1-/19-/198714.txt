hi, there!

does anyone know the original quote of the text spoken on the
detective's answering machine in the movie "shallow grave" (1994, uk)?

in the german synchronisized version it's something like

  "my buro is closed. nevertheless life gets irresistible to his final
  fate. maybe you want to leave in the meantime a note. the decision
  is only in you."

any hints?
