This is a favorite scene of my husband's and mine.  This guy (made up to be 
about 6'wide) actually pukes before they serve him, if I remember correctly.  
He has apparently already been making the restaurant rounds.  This puke 
involves major, hose-like projectile vomiting of greenish grey lumpy stuff and 
continues intermittantly (and deliberately aimed) onto the chore-lady they 
bring out with bucket to mop up his initial offerings.  [I'm stifling laughs 
even as I write] 

Then he eats a small banquet capable of feeding 12 normal sized persons.  It 
is the last, oh-so-small, after dinner mint forced upon him by the maitre-d' 
that results in his body exploding all over the room and other diners.  My 
spouse and I quickly learned that our, invariably laugh-choked discriptions 
of this scene (and the Catholic birthing) for others always results in faces 
of repulsion and disbelief.  Ya hadda be there.  Of course, there were only 
about 3 couples in the theatre and 2 walked out way before this scene. 

I don't get to see a lot of movies, so I can't make comparisons, but this 
scene gets my vote in this thread.
