about the topic "Re: DVD LIST OF AVAILABLE & ANNOUNCED TITLES - 03/05/96":


 those are typos - it should read LBX for Letterbox - sorry


 name on 1.85:1 anamorphic disc which doesnt fill out the entire
 anamorphic frame and thus isnt cropped ?
 the only title which has a very sligh black bar at the bottom is
 Dumb&Dumber - apart from that one, all of them are cropped to 1.78:1


 Batman Forever is cropped as well - just compare to the LD version
 there are no additional black bars in the anamorphic frame


 all of them are cropped but the others are too
