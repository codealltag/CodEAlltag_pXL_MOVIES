The formula for calculating the Top 250 Films gives a true Bayesian
estimate: 

 weighted rank (WR) = (v � (v+m)) � R + (m � (v+m)) � C
 where:
  R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating)
  v = number of votes for the movie = (votes)
  m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently
1250)
  C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.8)

Note: for this Top 250, only votes from regular voters are considered.
