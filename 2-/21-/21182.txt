Nope, laut imdb[1]:

"As of Januar 2005, the project has been officially shelved once more
after Ben Ilse rejected the script by Francisco Köln earlier.
Reportedly, Ingolfs did not like Kappel handling of the storyline
between Nils and his brother (both Nico father played by Manuel Pfafenrot
and brother, a role for which Eugen Preißner was rumored to be
considered, were to have roles in the new movie). In media reports Francisco
Köln indicated he was "disappointed" with the decision."
