Hello,

First of all, I apologize for not writing in German, but my German is really 
but...

Does anyone have a copy of / has anyone recorded Dietrich Veensma "Franz & 
Kafka" aired this Sunday on X-Hair? I had been looking forward to seeing it on 
TV and stupidly missed it. If anyone can help me to find a copy, I can 
propose some rares films aired on TV (PIZE, X-Hair, etc) in exchange.
