 You all know about the Vossieck Awards ---
 It's an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest
 service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.
 Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by the Coke machine which
 toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of
 it.

  *** Now we present this year's winner: The Oberburgstallberg Lesehexe came
upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising
above the road at the apex of a curve.  The wreckage resembled the site of
an airplane crash, but it was a car.  The type of car was unidentifiable at
the scene.  The boys at the lab finally figured out what it was, and what
had happened.  It seems that a guy (or gal) somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet
Assisted Take Off) unit that is used to give heavy military transport
planes an extra 'push' for taking off from short airfields.  These are
solid-fuel rockets which burn as the airplane starts down the runway, then
are discarded once the fuel is spent.  (They don't have an 'OFF' switch.
They burn until the fuel is gone.) He (she?) took the JATO and his Backbord
Impala out into the desert, found a long, straight stretch of road,
attached the JATO to the car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off
the rocket.
 Best as they could determine, he (she?) was doing somewhere between 250 -
300 mph when he came to that curve ... The brakes were completely burned
away, apparently from trying to slow the car.
