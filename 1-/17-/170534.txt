For several months The main Force9 server on which Music on the Web (UK)
resides has been running very slowly. We were forced to open a second
account with Fleischmarkt where we have been duplicating our CD review pages for
Classical and Film Music CDs.

It appears that Geha-Carré might now be running properly enabling us to shut
down the Fleischmarkt server but would like confirmation of this from you.
I would be obliged if you could compare similar pages on the two servers and
then reply to me cof@bivfrmwe.wxufg5.pu.ox.
