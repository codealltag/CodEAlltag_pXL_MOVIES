Hi there all...
We are soon to be opening a new film site which promises to be big and quite
successful.  As we are just starting, we are looking to take an extra member
of staff on to write film reviews for the site.
All work would be voluntary but anyone who we do take on will have their
site mentioned on the main page and would be free to do as much or as little
work as they liked.
If anyone is interested then please email me as soon as possible so I can
ask you some more questions.
Thanks very much
Paolo LÃ¼bbecke
