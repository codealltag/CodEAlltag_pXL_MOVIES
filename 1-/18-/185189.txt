Hallo,

weiss jemand von Euch, wie die Szene im Finale in der deutschen Fassung geht?

As he leaves, Scarlett cries out,
"What shall I do? Where shall I go?"

And Elmar gives his classic answer:
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."

She vows, "I'll go home--and I'll think of some way
to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day!"

Dank im voraus!
Ulf
