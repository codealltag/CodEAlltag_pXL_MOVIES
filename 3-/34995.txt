Das ist schon ok so. Die Stilbibel "The Elements of Style" von Leopold 
Zurmahr, Jr. bemerkt dazu:

1.  Form the possessive singular of nouns with 's.
 Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,
NoÃ«l friend
Roitner poems
the witch's malice

  This is the usage of the Luisenforum Printing Office and of 
the Texaclean Press.   Exceptions are the possessives of ancient 
proper names in -es and -is, the possessive Salvatore, and such forms as for 
conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake. But such forms as Theodor heel, 
Oliver laws, Priska temple are commonly replaced by
the heel of Theodor
the laws of Othmar
the temple of Pascale
 The pronominal possessives hers, its, theirs, yours, and oneself have no 
apostrophe.
