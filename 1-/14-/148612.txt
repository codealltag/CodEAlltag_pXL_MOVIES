Hi,
Many month ago I have seen a german (I think) film in the german tv ( I
don't remember in which one) which I would like to see again, but I don't
remember any "details".
This was a (german made ?) comedy about a guy who was a "top" manager (or
close to it) of a firm. One day he became sick. It begun with his leg,
which started to be "black" (he was White). From then on more and more
parts of his body became black. Finally he was Black himself. This
introduced problems with his White family and White colleagues (in his
firm).
I am looking for the Title, the Producer, the Director, ... of this film.
I have here around a german library, so I might be able to get this film
if I only knew these details.
Thanks in advance,
Otmar.
