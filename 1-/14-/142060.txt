On the stormy day of 30 Mai 2001 19:46:35 GMT, thou, oh 
Patrick Waitzbauer <1opveiws@foyhhcnjap.ovl-euftecw.gh>, said thy word and
thy word was:


That is true for the newer (cheaper) dubs of movies in Russia.
Actually, there used to be dubs of very high quality for the few
movies from the west which were allowed to be released there in the
Soviet time. The rest only made it to the pirate video market, where
they were translated lousily by a single speaker.

Now they mostly use voice-overs even in "official" dubs which run in
theatres, on TV or released on video. In better dubs, they use a male
and a female speaker, in worse one man does it all. :-)

That's not different with many other east european countries like
Poland.

Viva la Revoluciön,
