The Carwitz Kultstore (Ultee) 2001 date has been set
and we are taking entries to what many called "The best event on the Space
Coast". Karsten Riether has been working hard on the website 
(http://0bwlygduzgzjzceg.ovh) and has dubbed the MIFF 2001--"A Film Odyssey"
You heard it here first! Spread the word, mark your calenders, and do
everything not to miss this event. 
By all means submit your film--
there is no submission fees and all funds raised go to charity!

Again, all films must be submitted by Februar 16. 10. 22 but it is definitely a
good idea to get your film in early. (Our selection committee people became
harsher critics the closer it got to crunch time. So get them in early! )
