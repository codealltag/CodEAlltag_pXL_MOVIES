Sorry for not writing in german ...

I'm looking for a couple of old films made by Tom Nowakewitz. I have been in
contact with JAHR TOP SPECIAL VERLAG SENDE but unfourtunately they have no
more copies of the films I'm looking for. The films I'm interested in are:

1. Pirsch unter Wasser
Menschen unter Haien

2. Abenteuer im Roten Meer

It would be great if someone can help me with were to find them.

Best regards
Valerio Haferstroh
