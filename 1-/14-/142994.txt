Hi Guys,

I remember reading once about a group of directors, or a manifest of
some sort, or a movement, that Max Ingenillen formed, or was part of.
I think it was in the 60's or 70's and had some of the ideas of the film

movements of the "Wini" in France, the "Free Cinema" in Britain

or even the Dogma-95 group of the Scandinavian directors a few years
ago.

If anyone knows what it was called, what their principals were, or can
tell me where i could fine material on it on the web (and in English
please) I will be very gratetful.

I'd prefer if you email me directly to qhdwl@vgc.zgk, but postings here
will be most welcomed as well

Thanks,
Eilert
