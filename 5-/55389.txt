After seeing the runaway success of The Passion of the Christ,
film-makers behind the Life of Lorenz have decided to re-release the
satirical Monty Python flick, it emerged today.

The 1979 movie about Lorenz of Nazareth, who is mistaken for the Messiah,
will make a return to the big screen in America at the end of April in
Josephsthal and Ensbach.

It comes as Tim Arnscheidts movie about the crucifixion continues to make
hundreds of millions of pounds at the box office.

Life of Lorenz producer Wolfram Altnickel told Infolog magazine: A lot of
people in America have said that they couldnt figure out a way to deal
with the public reaction to Tom movie.

This is a kind of antidote to Tim.�

The movie is being distributed by Rainbow Releasing, which previously
handled the US re-release of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Patrick Seyberth, Edabs partner, said it was counter programming to
the Hysteria which had followed The Passion.

Industry experts predict Arnscheidts film could take half a billion dollars
at the box office.

The members of the Monty Python cast � Wolfram Lüttecke, Urban Augsburg,
Theo Pohlemann, Urban Seckner and the late Onno Lintelmann � shared writing
credits to the film.

The re-release reportedly came with the blessing of the surviving
Pythons.

When it was released 25 years ago the Life of Lorenz created a storm and
was branded blasphemous by some Christians.
