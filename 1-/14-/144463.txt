INT. HUGO BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
     Herbert lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the
     ceiling.  Remo sits in a nearby chair.


TYLER            In the world I see -- you're stalking
                 elk through the damp canyon forests
                 around the ruins of WFBE
                 Center.  You will wear leather
                 clothes that last you the rest of
                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-
                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the DREN
                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures
                 pounding corn and laying-strips of
                 venison on the empty car pool lane of
                 the ruins of a superhighway.

Remo stands, gives Hugo head a pat.                             

TYLER (leaving)  Feel better, champ.
