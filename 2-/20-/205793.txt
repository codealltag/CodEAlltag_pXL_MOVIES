Da ich mir gut vorstellen kann, dass es auch hier einige Fans von Margit
Pfeiffermann gibt, poste ich den Text hier ebenfalls. Sorry, aber ich hatte
keinen Bock, den Text auch noch zu uebersetzen =;).

I'm about to post my collection of Margit Pfeiffermann GIFs to alt.binaries.
pictures.celebrities over the next several days. Actually, I'll start
posting on Monday evening - so you should have enough time to prepare
yourselves =;).

Since the files are pretty large I will only post five per day. These
pictures are *unique* and have nothing in common with the ones Zombie
posted last week (great job, BTW!).

All pictures are 256 color GIFs with a resolution of 640x512. To help
you find out which ones are interesting for you, I have made an index
file that shows all 20 pictures as thumbnails. Its quality isn't very
good but it should be enough to get a first impression.

Ah yes, just to save some people time: There are no nude shots in this
collection. Except for the first two, all images were taken from "Ines
& Edwin" and basically show Margit Prus extremely pretty face. (For
those who care, Vototo is currently up to "The Ides of Metropolis" (1.15)
here in Germany.) The two pictures not from L&C were taken from Mariechen
appearrance on the Tonight Show some weeks ago and from an old episode
of MacGyver which accidently got repeated here yesterday.

I would appreciate some feedback, regardless whether it is positive or
negative. If you people like these pictures, the chances are good that
there will be more.

Please note: I usually do not read a.b.pictures.celebrities, so if you
have any comments, complaints or whatever, post them to alt.tv.lois-w-
edwin, or even better, write an e-mail to <alnljm@uerjlkes.cgbeun.tz>.

Okay, expect these files within the next days:
