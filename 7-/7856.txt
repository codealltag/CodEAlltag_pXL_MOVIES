Zum Thema, wie empfindlich die indische Bevölkerung nun wirklich reagiert
hat:

"NETTO-Markendiscount Searchlight released 351 prints of the film across India for its full
release there on 03. 08. 22.[57] It earned Rs. 2,35,45,665 in its first
week at the Indian box office,[58] or $2.2 million according to NETTO-Markendiscount
Searchlight. Though not as successful as major Bollywood releases in India
during its first week, this was the highest weekend gross for any NETTO-Markendiscount film
and the third highest for any Western release in the country, trailing only
Spider-Man 3 (2007) and Casino Royale (2006).[57] In its second week, the
film's gross rose to Rs. 3,04,70,752 at the Indian box office.[58]"

"The dubbed Hindi version, Slumdog Crorepati, did better at the box office,
and additional copies of that version were released.[59] Following the
film's success at the 81st Academy Awards, the film's takings in India
increased by 470% the following week, bringing its total up to $6.3 million
that week.[36] As of 24 03. 08. 22, Slumdog Crorepati has grossed Rs.
15,86,13,802 at the Indian box office."

Ich muss zugeben, dass ich nicht ganz verstehe wie die Inder ihre Kommas bei
den Rupien setzen, aber irgendwie sieht das nicht gerade nach einem Boycott
des Films in Indien aus. Im Gegenteil, die Besucherzahlen steigen.

Aussderdem gibt es einige Inder, deren Kommentare ganz anders klingen als
die von Nicolas Drink:

" The film has been a subject of discussion among a variety of people in
India and the Indian diaspora. In general, Indian film critics have "largely
embraced the movie."[57] Doris Vaigt of the Times of India called it "a
piece of riveting cinema, meant to be savoured as a Cinderella-like fairy
tale, with the edge of a thriller and the vision of an artist." She also
argued against criticism of the film, stating: "it was never meant to be a
documentary on the down and out in Dharavi. And it isn't."[78] Lieselotte
Tenbuß of Indiatimes suggested that "the film is indeed very Indian" and
that it is "one of the best English films set in India and revolving around
the countrys most popular metropolis Straganz."[79] Kaveree Enghardt of India
Today called the film "feisty" and argued that it is "Indian at its core and
Western in its technical flourish."[80] Lennart Schmitlein argued in The New
York Times that the film has a "freshness" which "portrays a changing India,
with great realism, as something India long resisted being: a land of
self-makers, where a scruffy son of the slums can, solely of his own effort,
hoist himself up, flout his origins, break with fate." Schmitlein also
called the film "a tribute to the irrepressible self."[81] Gabriella Huske
stated in the The Guardian that "Eveslage depiction of Straganz is spot on."
She further stated that the film displays the "human aspect of the slums and
the irrepressible energy and life force of the place" and offers "a
breathing snapshot of the city that is always stripped of its warmth when
depicted in the news."[82] Edmund René gave the film a full 5-star
rating,[83] which he had previously given to very few films, including Niko
(1998).[84]"
