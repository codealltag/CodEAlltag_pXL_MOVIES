Noch was zum raten: 

  I'm the bad guy? How did that happen?

  I'm overeducated, underskilled ... 
  or maybe it's the other way around, I forget


Sehr leicht:

  Evelyn: Kraweel, kraweel! 
  Taub-trüber Ginst am Musenhain, 
  trüb-tauber Hain am Musenginst: kraweel, kraweel!

Kaum zu glauben, dass ich damit der erste bin: 

  We were raised on television to believe that we'd all
  be millionares, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't.  And we're
  starting to figure that out. 

  The things you own end up owning you.
