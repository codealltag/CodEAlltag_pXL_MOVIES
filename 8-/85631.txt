Hi there,
My first posting in this group, hope you folks bear with me. Please excuse 
my use of English as I can see these are German language group.
I'm trying to find out the title of a b/w German film (comedy) shown with 
subtitles on Spanish TV about 15 years ago, directed sometime in the late 
'50s early '60s (I think). Synopsis is as follows:
Germany, midst of economic post-war miracle reconstruction. Aging fraudster 
is released after a long term in gaol, doesn't know what to do with 
himself, starts up a racket selling medals of merit to important 
industrialists (by post), purportedly from ministry in recognition  etc...
Gets more than he bargained for when one of the industrialists wants to 
come in person to receive his medal, rather than by post, ends up with an 
office at ministry.
Could anyone help me identify this movie?
Many thanks in advance,
