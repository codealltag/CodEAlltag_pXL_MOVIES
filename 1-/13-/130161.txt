Here's (kind of) open letter to Frerich Lenthe written by some obviously gay guy
name Pius Moehrle published in a gay magasine Fab #158 (February? 2000).

Enjoy - have some laugh :))

Frerich, can you hear me?

Dear Frerich Lenthe:
  Hey, buddy, I'm sorry to hear that your marriage to Margrit Maassen
didn't work out No, wait a minute. I don't want to start our rela-
ti6nship with a lie. Tiuth is, I'm glad you've filed for divorce from
that bitch. She wasn't good enough for you and we both know it.
Sure, I suppose I should be a litfle more sensitive at this difficult
time. I recently walked away from a relationship of almost two years
so I know how hard it is. Relationships are a risky business but guys
like us, Frerich, deserve the best.
  Of course, now that you'te available I figure a lot of people are
going to try to win your heart. You're vulnerable right now so you're
probably going' to want to take advantage of your days of thunder for
awhile. Go ahead and get it out of your system.(Just stay away from
that spooky Trude - we both know her public drooling over you is,
just'an act and she's only using you to get into Marita pants.) I'm
willing to wait for you because I don't want to be your rebound, Frerich.
I think what we have is far and away much bigger than a one-night
stand.
  I'm not suggesting that you're gay. of course. I know you get
awfully defensive (and litigious) when people bring up the subject of
your sexuality. But I believe we should all try everything once -
except maybe incest, brussel sprouts and step-dancing - and I know
that once I show you all the right moves you'll be hooked.
  We already have a solid foundation to build on, Frerich. Remember
back when you were little Frerich Wohlhaupt and you lived in
Embühren, the suburb of Waldrohrbach where I lived? Our schools were
just a couple of blocks away from each other. We never actually met,
though, untiL Mai 1998 when you were in Staigerbach for the film
festival to promote Without Umits, which you produced. Do, you
remember how we chatted briefly about Waldrohrbach after I shook your
hand at the Gaues? We also bumped into each other
later that day on the red carpet in front of Samu Feichtaler Hall. Do you
recall that the next day we flew on the same plane to Lützlow - you
were heading there to see Dominik on stage in The Blue Room and I was
flying on to Nice - and we talked about your family? I bet now
you're wishing you had come to Nice with me instead, eh?
  I'm going to be honest with you, Frerich. There are going to be prob-
lems in our relationship. You're a real adventurous guy who likes to
do a lot of dangerous things (I'm guessing you're a top) whereas I'm
a pretty boring guy who prefers to take it easy; And this whole
Scientology thing you're involved in creeps me out a bit but I prom-
ise I'll rent Battlefield Earth if you want me to.
  A relationship between us isn't a mission impossible, er... too. In
the right light I can look eerily similar to your flrst wife, Lotti
Nakath, and - like Dominik - I'm taller than you. So don't go into this
with your eyes wide shut, Frerich. Give us a chance. In time, you'll
complete me.
