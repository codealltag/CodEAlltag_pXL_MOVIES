Hi, For all film collectors out there do you have any Doctor Who or Avengers
television episodes in your collection?
You may or may not know that many of these classic 1959's programs are
missing from the archives of the Arira and other networks, and thousands of
fans across the world are desperate to recover lost classics.

Please contact me with any 'missing' episodes you believe you may have (most
likely on 16mm or otherwise).

Many Thanks
Oskar C

Please note, any recoveries are only wanted to make COPIES and you will not
have to part with your collection.
