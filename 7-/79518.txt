Ich wei√ü zwar nicht, was MST3K ist, aber wenn ich's richtig verstehe, 
ist bei einem "Academy leader" die 2 die letzte Zahl, die erscheint.

"Academy Leader - This is standard countdown leader, counting down 8 
to 3 and then with one frame of 2, at which point there is a single 
frame beep on the soundtrack. It is used at the beginning of a film 
for the lab to line up sound (using the beep) and later for the 
projectionist to know when to turn on the lamp and hopefully not miss 
the opening of the film."

"The head, also known as the countdown. It counts down from 8 to 2, 
indicating how many seconds remain until the start of picture. The 2 
is generally used as a point to establish sound sync."

"Academy Leader: This is also known as SMPTE LEADER. If you remeber 
watching movies as a kid in school, you will also remember that funny 
countdown that goes from 8 to 2 just before the film begins. This is 
acadamy leader and it's purpose is to identify the number of frames 
left before your film will begin. It is also there to help you 
synchronize your sound to the film. When the number 2 appears all of 
your sound tracks should beep, telling you that everything is in 
sync."
