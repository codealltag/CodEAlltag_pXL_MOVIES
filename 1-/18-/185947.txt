Hi
I'm collecting links on Movie/Animation/VFX-pages to make a ref. page
for everyone working in the biz. Up to now there are already over 200
links and it'll grow and grow. So if you need a link for Studios, FX
Houses, Newsgroups, Software, Hardware..... visit:

http://dgt.sppstgfemxs.vlg/kzua/

If you want your link on my site just mail me. (If I get enough links
from Artists I'll include an artists section)
