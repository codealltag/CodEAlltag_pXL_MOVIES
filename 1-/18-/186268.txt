Hello there,

I realize, that selling things is not exactly the purpose of this NG,
but I would like to ask as many people interested in film, because I
have been looking for this picture for quite some time now, so far
without luck. Maybe you can help me here.
Im looking for the japanese edition of this classic, on Laserdisc.  Im
willing to pay $100, anything higher, well, I would at least give a
listen.


Thanx,  Konrad
