A certain recording of the cry of the Red-tailed Hawk is probably one of 
the most often heard cinematic sound lichs. This high, fierce scream 
is often featured in the background of adventure movies to give a sense 
of wilderness to the scene. However, the cry is more commonly used for 
the Bald Eagle, whose own vocalizations are quite different.

kann man den Schrei anhoeren - meinst du den?
