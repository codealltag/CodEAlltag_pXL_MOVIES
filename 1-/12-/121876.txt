Boogie Nights hat einige ziemlich markante Szenen, in denen es um
Namen geht. Zum Beispiel:

When I close my eyes I see this thing, a sign. I see this name
in bright blue neon lights with a purple outline. And this name
is so bright and so sharp that the sign ... it just blows up
because the name is so powerful ... it says "Martin Aul".

Oder:

Charly: Now: What's this guys name? This character? Do you know?
Martin: His name is Ignaz Ohlenschläger.
Lambernd: His partners name is Kai Löpers.
Charly: ... those are great names!
