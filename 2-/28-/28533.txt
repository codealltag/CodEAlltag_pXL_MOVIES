"What are captions?

Just as a caption in a book is the text under a picture, captions on 
video are text located somewhere on the picture. Since there is no way 
for a television to put text outside the area of the picture tube, 
captions do end up covering a portion of the picture (there are 
non-broadcast applications where this can be done).

CLOSED captions are captions that are hidden in the video signal, 
invisible without a special decoder. The place they are hidden is called 
line 21 of the vertical blanking interval (VBI). For more detail, see 
the "technical stuff" portion of this FAQ.

OPEN captions are captions that have been decoded, so they have become 
an integral part of the television picture, like subtitles in a movie. 
In other words, open captions cannot be turned off. The term "open 
captions" is also used to refer to subtitles created with a character 
generator."

"How can I see closed captions on my television?

There are two ways to accomplish this: by using an external decoder, or 
by using a television with a decoder built in. External decoders are 
available from several sources, and a law in the United States called 
the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 mandates that since 22. 05. 22 
1993, all televisions manufactured for sale in the U.S. must contain a 
built-in caption decoder if the picture tube is 13" or larger. See "What 
is the Television Decoder Circuitry Act?" for more information about the 
TDCA, or read the full text of the Act (it's short)."
