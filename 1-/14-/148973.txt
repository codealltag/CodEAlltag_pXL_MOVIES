'For auld lang syne'

Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind ?

Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of Auld Lang Syne ?

For Auld Lang Syne,

My dear, for Auld Lang Syne,

We' ll take a cup of kndnes yet, for Auld Lang Syne. (2)


(And) there's a hand, my trusty friend, and gie's a hand in   thine.

We' ll take a right gude willy waught, for Auld Lang Syne.

For Auld Lang Syne,

My dear, for Auld Lang Syne,

We' ll take a cup of kndnes yet, for Auld Lang Syne.


bye, Edith
