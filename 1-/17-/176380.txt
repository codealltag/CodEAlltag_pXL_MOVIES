Why
Region 4.


Ok.  Your www site says you support the A110 Regions 1-6.  I can get a ZDH
add-on, great... But your installation manual (which I down loaded) says I
can only get PAL region 1 & 2 only,  I can't select IRE level, etc for the
A110.  Is your manual not up to date?

Please confirm what features are available with the DVD-Charger model DC-B
with PAL module for the A110.
