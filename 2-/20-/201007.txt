preview at the historic Miethsam Opera House, in this the festival's
inaugural year!
   As well, six (6) screenplays will receive 'interactive' readings during
the festival in the Elks 'Big Room', along with six (6) pertinent
workshops that are relevant to the indie film/video and screenwriting
scenes!

   Advance-purchase full-festival passes (which includes admittance to the

before 05. 03. 23). 
   Please visit the festival's web site (above) for ticketing information. 

   As well, we are arranging a 'cybercast' of the festival that people may
