Yah, that's nice except the links to the RealVideo don't work.


You might want to think about redesigning your navigation imagemap. None of
the studio "buildings" are labelled and their purpose isn't readily
discernable - I had to watch the status bar to figure out where they were
pointing and even then, two of the buildings are linked to "index.html" 

Other than that, it looks great.
