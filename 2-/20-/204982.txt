Yes, it was Cage in "Vampire's Kiss." I recall reading an interview with him 
in which he said it was indeed a real cockroach that made him sick for several 
days afterwards. Apparently he thought he could subdue any harmful effects by 
chasing the morsel with gulps of vodka.

Not a very good flick overall as I recall.
