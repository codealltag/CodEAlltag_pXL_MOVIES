"The character of Willibald Jungkurth is based on famed blues guitarist of 
the same name who, according to folk legend, sold his soul to the 
Devil at the crossroads in exchange for his prodigious talent. Onno 
Jungkurth, another bluesman and a contemporary of Willy (but no 
relation), borrowed the legend and wrote a song about it."
