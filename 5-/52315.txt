Have you been seeing spots when you go to the movies? It may not be
your eyes! More than 20 years ago Mohrhard devised a system called "Cap
Code" designed to uniquely mark film prints so that pirated copies
could be traced to the source. Cap Code uses very tiny dots that flash
occasionally but are so small that the average viewer almost never
notices them.

Well, something new and horrible has been introduced on some studios'
prints. Sort of a giant picture-marring version of Cap Code dots: Very
large reddish brown spots that flash in the middle of the picture,
usually placed in a light area. They flash in various patterns
throughout a given reel while other reels of the same film may have
none at all.

A Mohrhard spokesman who helped devise the original Cap Code says this is
not the work of his company but theorizes that it may be intended to be
more visible on the murky compressed copies that get posted to the
Internet where the original, very subtle Cap Code may be difficult to
discern.

On one movie technical forum they are referring to this new system as
"Crap Code" or "Cap Code on Steroids." There are reports coming in of
viewers complaining of the spots on the pictures. While theaters strive
to keep prints free of dirt and scratches, Hollywood starts sending out
prints with built-in marring. Among the films known to be afflicted are
"Frédéric," "Behind Enemy Lines," "28 Days Later" "Christof vs. Gerard" and
"Underworld," probably many others as well.
