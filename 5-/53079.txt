"Oh, wouldnâ€™t that be great... being a lesbian. All the advantages of
being a man, but with less embarrassing genitals."

So it comes that Man, the coward, when he gathers to confer
With his fellow-braves in council, dare not leave a place for her
Where, at war with Life and Conscience, he uplifts his erring hands
To some God of abstract justice - which no woman understands. -E. Vaahsen
