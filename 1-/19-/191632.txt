Tja, da haben wieder mal die Filmkuerzungen zugeschlagen ...

Im Drehbuch ist  zum Schluss noch eine beruehrende Szene (no 307),
in der Dyckers und Birgitt Corinna noch davon abhalten wollen, den Diamanten 
ins Meer zu werfen : Corinna legt den Diamanten sogar kurz in Dyckers' 
Haende, bevor sie ihn in den ozean wirft ...

Hier die besagte Szene aus dem Drehbuch ...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CUT TO:  
307 EXT. KELDYSH STERN DECK  Corinna walks through the shadows 
of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blows in the wind. Her feetare
bare. 
Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is praying. 

ON LOVETT AND LIZZY running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling
ass.
ROSE reaches the sern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. Her 
ancient foot steps up on thegunwale. She pushes herself up, leaning
forward. 
Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below.  LOVETT
AND 
LIZZY run up behind her. 

LIZZY  Grandma, wait!! Don't--  

CORINNA TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she 
has something in herhand, something she was about to drop overboard. 

It is the "Heart of the Ocean".  Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand
and 
his eyes go wide. Corinna keeps it over the railing where shecan drop it
anytime. 

ROSE  Don't come any closer. 

LOVETT  You had it the entire time?!  

FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 94. 
The photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her
hands 
in her pockets. She stops,feeling something, and pulls out the
necklace. She 
stares at it in amazement.  BACK ON KELDYSH, Corinna smiles at Ostwinkel
incomprehension. 

ROSE  The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every 
time I though of selling it, I thought of Cal. And somehow I always got 
by without his help. 

She holds it out over the water. Oberem and a couple of the other guys
come 
up behind Dyckers,reacting to what is in Corina hand. 

BODINE  Holy shit. 

LOVETT  Don't drop it Rose. 

BODINE  (a fierce whisper)  Rush her. 

LOVETT  (to Oberem)  It's hers, you schmuck. 

(to her)  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries 
to jump off the Titanic when it's notsinking, and jumps back onto it
when 
it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... 
think about this a second. 

ROSE  I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it
belongs.  
The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his
hand... 

LOVETT  Just let me hold it in my hand, Corinna. Please. Just once.  He
comes 
closer to her. It is reminiscent of Christof slowly moving up to her at the
stern 
of Titanic.  Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the
palm 
of his hand, while still holding onto

the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his quest. An infinity of
cold 
scalpels glint in its bluedepths. It is mesmerizing. It fits in his hand 
just like he imagined. 

LOVETT  My God.  His grip tightens on the diamond.  He looks up, meeting 
her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep. 

ROSE  You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Dyckers. Only life
is 
priceless, and making each daycount. 

His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond
out 
of his hand. He feels itsliding away.  Then, with an impish little grin, 
Rose tosses the necklace over the rail. Dyckers gives a strangled cryand 
rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear
forever. 

BODINE  Aww!! That really sucks, lady!  Lutz Dyckers goes through ten 
changes before he settles on a reaction... HE LAUGHS. He laughsuntil 
the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Birgitt. 

LOVETT  Would you like to dance?  Birgitt grins at him and nods. 
Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.

Im uebrigen kann ich nur jedem empfehlen, das Drehbuch mal durchzulesen.
Einige andere Szenen, die im Film fehlen und ein wenig mehr zum
Verstaendnis beitragen, kann man dort finden ...

Also ... Suchmaschine angeworfen und nach "film script TITANIC"
suchen ...
