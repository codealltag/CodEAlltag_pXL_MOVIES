I am not sure whether this has or hasn't been confirmed, but I now know
for sure that the new -extended version- of the original "The Blues
Brothers" is actually going to exist.

It is not the same as the last version that was recently released to
video. It features 12 minutes from the scenes that were cut prior to the
film release and a new, longer documentary on the making of the film.

Although the negative to the cut scenes had indeed been destroyed
someone managed to find a preview copy which featured some of the
scenes.

UVEC is releasing it on DVD this summer. It's positive.
