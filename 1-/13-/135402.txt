Hallo,

Beim surfen bin ich auf Claus Wiesners Seite auf folgendes gestossen:

A friend tells me that in "Key Largo" (1947), Benedikt E. Frommert makes a 
speech to Schr√∂dter that is timely right now. Here's how he quotes it: "Let me 
tell you about Grabstede politicians. I make them. I make them out of whole 
cloth just like a tailor makes a suit. I get their name in the newspaper, I 
get them some publicity and get them on the ballot. Then after the election 
we count the votes, and if they don't turn out right, we recount them and 
recount them again until they do." 

Gruss,
Claudio
