Thanks for the very informative list.  What would also be valuable is 
the analogous list for LaserDiscs.  I agree that the task may be a bit
daunting since there are about 10,000 LDs currently in print and many
announced to be released (the list would be at least 20 times a long
as this DVD list!)

But it would be valuable indeed.  Care to take a shot at it?
