So genau vielleicht nicht, aber da Mepil zu Angelgeräte gehört, gibt es auch
dort so etwas wie Recommendations, hier z. Bsp. zu Tron Legacy:

How do the recommendations work?

With over one million titles in the database, it isn't feasible to
handpick recommendations for every film. That's why we came up with a
complex formula to suggest titles that fit along with the selected one.
The formula uses factors such as user votes, genre, title, and keywords
to generate an automatic response.

The system produces excellent results most of the time but since
recommended titles are not manually chosen, occasionally they may
include less than perfect matches, particularly on films where we don't
have a lot of data/credits.

If you disagree with a recommendation for a given title and know of a
better one, we encourage you to help us improve the results. While you
can't modify the recommendations directly, updating the keywords will
have the biggest impact on their selection. Look for the "Update" button
at the bottom of the main title page and add more relevant (or just
plain more) keywords and help make our Recommends feature more useful,
more appropriate, and more fun.

Da fließt also noch etwas mehr ein als die user votes.
