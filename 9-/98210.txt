The whisper of Alex Joosten-Verh체ldonk resounds through the universe:


Den hab ich noch nicht gesehen.

Wie sieht es aus mit:

"David, move me!"

"Oh no, I'll help. You can always depend on the old spy fucker."

"Who did you say is calling?"
"This IS the president."
"Year, right. And I'm the first lady"

"I was in Lichtenstein at a party last night... so I'm afraid I'm a bit hung
over. Wish I could lying with my head in a toilet like all normal
people."

etwas leichter:

"You know we're sitting on four million pounds of fuel, one nuclear
weapon and a thing that has 270,000 moving parts built by the lowest
bidder. Makes you feel good, doesn't it?"
