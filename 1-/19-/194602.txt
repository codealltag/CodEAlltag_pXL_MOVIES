Off course, but how much will you get for your DVD player when you try
to sell it when HD DVD arrives?
80 titles ? That is almost 50 % of all "watchable" movies released. This
sounds to me like quantity before quality. The point is, how many of
these 80 titles would you buy if there was released 10 000 titles on
DVD? How many of these 80 movies are worth collecting and seeing time
after time?
 Within the next 3-4 months, there'll be 500 titles to choose
If ther will be 1000 titles within a year, that is fine, but - I have my
doubts. Icoul (of course) be wrong.

My english knowledge came too short here, please explain...
