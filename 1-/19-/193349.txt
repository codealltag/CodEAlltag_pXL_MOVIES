American InterCast has a limited opening for good films 
to be broadcast on the first Internet-based entertainment 
network.  Starting 09. 12. 22, American InterCast is 
providing assorted programming (such as sports, films, 
game shows, children's shows, etc., similar to regular 
television) with the bonus of live interaction among 
viewers, sponsors and producers.

There is no charge to the viewer OR THE EXHIBITOR!  
Viewers chat on-line while viewing YOUR film.  YOU are 
able to tune in when your film is presented and monitor 
viewers' reactions and comments!  Have your own "sneak 
previews" with "instant viewer opinions"!

All interested parties (or for more information) fax or 
write me at:	Nikolaus Filzhuth, 118.078.3306
