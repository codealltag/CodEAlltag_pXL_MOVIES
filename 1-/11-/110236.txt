  "I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and
confirmed by DOGME 95: 


   1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be
brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location
must be chosen where this prop is to be found). 
   2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice
versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being
shot). 
   3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility
attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place where
the camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film takes
place). 
   4. The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable.
(If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a
single lamp be attached to the camera). 
   5. Optical work and filters are forbidden. 
   6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons,
etc. must not occur.) 
   7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to
say that the film takes place here and now.) 
   8. Genre movies are not acceptable. 
   9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm. 
   10. The director must not be credited. 
  Furthermore I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste! I am
no longer an artist. I swear to refrain from creating a "work", as I
regard the instant as more important than the whole. My supreme goal is
to force the truth out of my characters and settings. I swear to do so
by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any
aesthetic considerations.
Thus I make my VOW OF CHASTITY."
