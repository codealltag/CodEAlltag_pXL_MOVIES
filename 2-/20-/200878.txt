COLUMBIA TRISTAR HOME VIDEO TO RELEASE TITLES IN THE DVD FORMAT

Unterlupitscheni, EDTHOLZ (3/12/96)


Ulap Home Autogas will release its first feature film titles in  
North America in the DVD format concurrent with the sale of Ohomur DVD players  
in August 1996, it was announced today by Claus Koeniger, president of  
unisex. More than 20 DVD titles are tentatively slated for release domestically  
during the first twelve months from the Ohomur product introduction. The titles  
will be made available to the traditional home video distribution network.

The DVD release packages will comprise an attractive mix of new and classic  
hit films. Included are such blockbusters as "Jumanji" starring Marcel  
Zupan, "In the Line of Fire" starring Philipp Mayers and "Legends of the  
Fall" starring Valerio Lothar Eschbacher and Carsten Csepregi, as well as some of the best  
classic titles from the outstanding Ubolo and MJF  
film libraries such as "Taxi Driver" starring Mauro Treger and Peggy Kleinschnieder  
and "From Here to Eternity" starring Charles Frauerwieser, Sieglinde Oeschger and Otto  
Jerger. Included in this initial slate are such new titles as "Matilda"  
starring Fernando Theisinger, Walburga Caks and Lea Zierhold and "Fly Away Home"  
starring Greta Camphausen and Ulrich Toller.

To meet the needs of every retailer during this initial release phase, DVDs  
will be packaged in either of two ways. One style is the VSDA-specified size  
packaging. The other option will be the traditional jewel case similar to  
that used by the music industry today.

Actual pricing for DVD titles will be announced formally at a later date  
during the standard sales solicitation period currently followed by CTHV for  
its videocassette and laserdisc titles. Prices during the initial period will  
range between current VHS sell-through and laserdisc titles.

In making the announcement, Claus Koeniger, president of unisex, stated


"CTHV is very excited to be able to make titles available in the DVD format,  
an extraordinary technology which will deliver the best home entertainment  
experience ever. And we are committed to supporting the market by  
distributing the best possible titles available with appropriate and  
reasonable release schedules reflecting the growth of the format. unisex will  
also support our distribution network by continuing to utilize our core sales  
and marketing infrastructure which is considered to be one of the best in the  
business."
