Zumindest im script wird das von Hirthe bewusst offengelassen,
sollte man wohl auch dabei belassen:


309  INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH

A GRACEFUL PAN across Anke shelf of carefully arranged pictures:

Anja as a young actress in Sudheim, radiant... a theatrically lit
studio publicity shot... Anja and her husband, with their two
children... Anja with her son at his college graduation... Anja with her
children and grandchildren at her 70th birthday.  A collage of images of
a life lived well.

THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame.  Anja, circa 1920.  She is at
the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline.  The Fohlenplacken pier,
with its rollercoaster is behind her.  She is grinning, full of life.

We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk.  A
profile shot.  She is very still.  She could be sleeping, or maybe
something else.

CUT TO:

310  THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark...
