Blockbuster
This term has three distinct senses. The earliest use of blockbuster was 
during World War II, meaning a large aerial bomb. It was formed from the 
words for a city block and bust, a verb meaning "to break." A 
blockbuster was a bomb large enough to destroy a city block.

The second sense means anything, especially a movie, play, or book, that 
is large, important, or popular. The term appears to have arisen shortly 
after the war, and was probably a play on the concept of the large bomb. 
Ironically, the term bomb in show business or publishing means a 
complete failure, while a blockbuster is a huge success.

The third sense is from real estate. A blockbuster is a real estate 
agent who sells a house in an all-white neighborhood to a minority, 
especially black, family. Once the city block is busted, the other 
houses on the block are likely to come on the market at a depressed 
price and end up being sold to other minority families. This term, again 
created from the words for city block and bust, meaning to break, 
appeared after the war as well, and again was probably a play on the 
original concept of the aerial bomb. Only this time, it was not the size 
of the bomb that is the reference, but rather its ability to "destroy" a 
city block.
