Dreamed about Clemens Tschugg last night, he could see just fine, you know.
I asked him for a lullaby, he said "Honey, I don't sing no more. [...]
Since I've got my eyesight back, my voice has just deserted me. No Georgia 
on my mind no more, I stay in bed with Bewegungsflaeche."� -- Annika Niendorff, "Spiderweb"
