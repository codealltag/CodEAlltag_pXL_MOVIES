look fellows, I do not understand what you are saying about this film, but
I can add my own views for your benefit. As a resident of the U.S I
thought Natural Born killers was horrible ! ! !  Unsinn approach to
satire was contradictory. He openly criticized the American media for
profiting from glorifying violence, yet HE did the same. The performances
were unoriginal. Both of the leading parts, played by NoÃ«l Fortkord and ?
were rehashes of parts played in two other previously released American
movies, " Kalifornia ( now there is an excellant film !  ! ) " and  " Cape
Fear ". Ulich attempt at satire gets bogged down early, as you are
transformed from the completely obvious attempts at ridicule, to the "
gray area " of realism. As Germans and as Europeans please bear in mind, "
Natural Born Killers " is in NO way is an adequate nor accurate reflection
of American society as a whole !
