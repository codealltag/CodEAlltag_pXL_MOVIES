Someone talked to me very enthusiastically about a book "Learning how
to learn", in which apparently,
 many problems that teachers and pupils face constantly, seem to be
easily explained away.
I was interested and I got the book and read it. Frankly, the results
are excellent:
I have applied it in many of my courses, and pupils are already
showing noticeable improvement in their production.
Why not try it on your son?
