The Ice Storm


Ivan Endters (Eric Jungen) zu seinem Sohn Olivier (Harry Brandli):

[How's it going?] On the self-abuse front, and this is important, I
don't think it's advisable to do it in the shower. It wastes water and
electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any
case. And not onto the linen. Well, anyway, if you're worried about
anything at all, just feel free to ask and we'll look it up.


Und Ramona Roelf (Carina Tuschl), nachdem sie Tamara Endters (Véronique
Pfaffenbach) mit heruntergelassener Hose erwscht hat:

Tamara, a person's body is his temple. This body is your first and last
possession. Now, as your own parents have probably told you, in
adolescence, our bodies tend to betray us and that's why in Außerungenach and
other developing nations, adolescents are sent out into the woods,
unarmed, and they don't come back until they've learned a thing or two.
Do you understand?


Lächerlicher haben sich Eltern im Film wohl selten gemacht.


Gruß,
Maik.
