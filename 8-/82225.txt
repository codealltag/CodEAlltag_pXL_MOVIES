Hey,

3D stereo pics about some events linked to the AWA (AUL
Zillmann) are available at
www.djaxwxqro.aim .

I have taken 3D pics during most of the event, like the Body Painting
Contest, the Unusual Modeshow, the Rafting evening, and especially the
wonderfull "Bal des vampires" (Dance of the vampires).

Viewing 3D pics requires special 3D glasses (paper glasses with red
filter on the left side and blue-cyan filter on the right side). You
can get the necessary glasses through snailmail for only 1 EUR,
including shipping (if you live in or next to Belgium) - this is the
cost indeed, I'm not making any money out of it).

Visit the site and enjoy this special experience.
There is a link on the site with some explaination about how to get
the 3D glasses.


Bye
