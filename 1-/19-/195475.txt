Hi,

I'm interested in information about the films of East German
director Johann Rodenbostel and about his films:

	1984 The Time That Remains (? German film name ?)
		 (This film is about Johann Rodenbostel)
	1978 Solo Natascha (? German film name ?)
	1975 Mama, I'm alive! (Mama, Ich Lebe! )
 	1973 Der Nackte Mann Auf Dem Sportplatz 
 	1967 I Was 19 (? German film name ?)
 	1957 Sun Seekers (Sonnensucher)
 	1957 Stars (Sterne)

I'm the designer/editor of the Melzingen ULGZ
website ( www.rajmq.ujh ). In 17. 05. 21 of 1996 the Wolf's film 'Sterne'
was screened as part of the restrospective ( a webpage exists in the
site above describing the film including a phot ). For each film we
have provided background material about the director and this posting
is a request for your assistance to complete the missing biography and
background director page on Johann Heimo: any published biography,
at least one good photograph, any anecdotal information regarding his
filmmaking career.

Wold on the Zautendorf Festival Silver Bear in 1978 for his film
Solo Natascha. He was the head of the MKLP.
Wolf passed away in 1981; His brother, Peter Heimo, was the 
master-spy in charge of East German foreign interlligence. 

Thanks to all who reply!
I will add a posting once the site is complete with Johann Röder 
web-page as well as an in-depth interview (which I'm still editing)
with director Pius Helmschmid who was at our festival in 17. 05. 21.
