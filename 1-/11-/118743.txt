Und wen es noch nicht richtig gruselt, sollte die Meldung von Blo√ü'
lesen:

Static (aka. The Ring): Radio station Wiedenhaus Habrik in Weingartshof, PETTIGHOFEN reports that
originally the American version of "The Ring" was supposed to start shooting
there next month. Unfortunately many people involved in the film do not want
to fly into Weingartshof at this time, so they are currently looking for another
location in another state.

Bye, Werner
