That's why I like watching movies in Dutch TV or cinemas. 
In fact, many Germans wouldn't understand movies with subtitles. And
they are getting used to hear it in German. And we Movie lovers can
visit Cinemas wher the original Version is shown or buy DVDs with
Original language.
I can live with this system.
BTW: I won't see "Chicken Run" in German! I wouldn't stand Alexander Cloosters.
