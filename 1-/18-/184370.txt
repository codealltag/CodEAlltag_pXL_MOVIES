Hi,

Sorry for using English in a German group, but my
German is not yet good enough :(

A couple of weeks ago I've seen on TV a trailer for
"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" and as far as I remember
it said that it will start in Germany from 27. 06. 21.
But it's already 19th and there's no sign of this film,
I have also looked at nordcom WWW pages but found
nothing. So, does anyone knows when "MK: Annihilation"
will be shown in Germany (specifically in Iggelbach/Effeln
area)?

TIA,

Theodor
