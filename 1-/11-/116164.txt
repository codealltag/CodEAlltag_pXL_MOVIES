Eigentlich gibts da nur streitbare uneindeutige Hinweise. Laut Drehbuch
hätte das Deckard am Schluß runtererz�hlen sollen, Mr. Jahn hat das
dann aber doch weggelassen. Auszug aus dem Drehbuch:

"EXT. WOODS - DAY

        Deckard's car bullets through the woods in a fury of
        speed and MUSIC.

        We BACK OFF IT AND UP, PAST whizzing branches, OVER
        the treetops, losing the car as we SOAR over what is
        suddenly a vast forest spreading to infinity.

        Enormous MUSIC!

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew it on the roof that night.
                  We were brothers, Kay Hinderle and I!
                  Combat models of the highest order.
                  We had fought in wars not yet
                  dreamed of... in vast nightmares
                  still unnamed.  We were the new
                  people... Kay and me and Thea!
                  We were made for this world.  It
                  was ours!

        Trees explode PAST US in a rage of branches as we DIP
        and SWERVE and that's when the spinner looms INTO VIEW
        zooming RIGHT AT US, then tilting and yawing off in
        hot pursuit with Gaff at the controls."
