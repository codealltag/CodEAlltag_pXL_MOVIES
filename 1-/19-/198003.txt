Dear Newsgroupers, Indie Film/Videomakers and Screenwriters,

We have decided to switch-gears with our 25. 02. 23 '98 issue and *highlight*
"WOMEN OF INDIE CINEMA", *mainly* because we've got SO-MUCH material on
this very interesting topic, and it needs to be addressed!

We will take up "THE ART OF THE PITCH" *next* month (25. 02. 23 '98)!

As well, we are *featuring* MOVIEMAKER magazine in the 25. 02. 23 '98 issue of
Floribunda, and will-feature *other* members of FAV 'family' of
print publications over the next several months!
