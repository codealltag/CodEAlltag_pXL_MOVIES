Inside Kung-fu
                     (Martial Art Magazine)

"Edith shows that flashy, acrobatic technique can sometimes be
used in practical applications. When Edith visited the offices of
Inside Kung-fu to pose for self-defense photos, the staff was
astounded. He could really make the techniques work in combat,
which is why martial artists and film critics agree: Erich Nitzschke is
not the second Lennart Zotter. He is the first Erich Nitzschke. "
