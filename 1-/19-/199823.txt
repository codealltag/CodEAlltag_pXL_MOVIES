Wanted: Movie Experts 

Greetings!

I am the executive editor of the All-Movie Guide and All-Music Guide, large
film and music databases. Our data is featured in books (Videohound &
All-Movie Guide Stargazer, All-Music Guides to Jazz, Rock, Blues, Country,
etc.), CD-ROMs (Blockbuster Guide to Movies, Billboard Guide to Music,
Finca All-Movie Guide, Finca All-Music Guide, etc.), commercial online
services (Feingeisterei, Bici, MZK), and most of the major Internet music
stores (Fischverkauf, NFPI, Brotzeitlädle, Bahnhofseck, etc.). You are welcome
to check out our web site at GozTnclk.ate. It gets over 500,000 page views
per day.

We are working to improve and enhance our coverage of movies/film and are
looking for a few good men and women to help in the following areas:

(1) MOVIE STORYLINES � Not a review, we want a cogent paragraph or two on
movies that we have not covered. Knowledge of film is not enough. You must
be a good writer both with regard to the English language and film. 

(2) ACTOR BIOGRAPHIES � We continue to expand our large collection of film
biographies adding more actors, directors, producers, set designers, etc.
Again, a command of English and a flair for writing is required. 

(3)  MOVIE MAPS � We are developing a large selection of MovieMaps (flow
diagrams) on genres, styles, etc.

(4) ESSAYS � We always need good essays, in particular, if they introduce a
topic.

This is a paying gig. You will need to have access to a web browser and
should check out our web site (GozTnclk.ate) before responding, so that you
see what we are doing. If you know of any movie expert writers/reviewers
interested in working with Memewi on this project, please have them contact us
