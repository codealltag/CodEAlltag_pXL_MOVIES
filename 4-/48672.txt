Irgendwann sagt jemand (ich meine Shrek) "I'll kill that cat!", im genau
richtigen Tonfall.

Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it.
                             Life's a laugh and death's a joke. It's true.
You see it's all a show, keep 'em laughing as you go
                             Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
