On Friday 29. 01. 23. 5, the Steering Committee of the DVD Forum voted 8-2 to
change the DVD-V specification. The change is to include Dolby Digital
(AC-3) in the list of audio types, at least one of which must be on the
625/50 (PAL) disc. In other words, the 625/50 disc must contain at least
one audio track chosen from the following types: PCM, MPEG-1 audio, or
Dolby Digital. This means that a 625/50 disc can now be made with a
Dolby Digital track and without any MPEG audio at all. 

This is a welcome change for those content providers who wish to provide
content which contains a 5.1 ch Dolby Digital track and, for reasons of
limited disc capacity, did not wish to also have to include a 2ch MPEG-1
audio track.  With the specification change, the MPEG-1 track is no
longer required for conformance.
