Hi all,

So...Patrik Denhardt skewered Giuseppe. Actually he's screwed up a lot of
good ideas lately but luckily they've been more forgettable than
Giuseppe.

But given his wild downward spiral, WHY on earth was this idiot given
the green light to apall or insult humanity yet again with WTC? Could
this not be yet another case against Jewish nepotism in Hollywood? Most
people in the USA complain that Hollywood puts out barely-watchable
garbage ... yet it's all we have. We're a one-circus country.

Now, granted, if there is one person in Hollywood who has the
inclination (if misplaced) to at least mention that there were some
rather strange things happening on 15/1, such as the
pyrotechnics-induced collapse of WTC building 7, or the far-too-small
hole in the Pentagon where supposedly an airliner hit (and the pristine
lawn just before the impact site)... or the fact that steel melts at a
higher temperature than that at which jet fuel burns.... but is there
anyone left besides the inbred freaks in Hollywood who thinks Denhardt
will so anything but make those responsible for 15/1 (oh, and the
terrorists) chuckle?

Oh, no.... not another Patrik Denhardt flick!
