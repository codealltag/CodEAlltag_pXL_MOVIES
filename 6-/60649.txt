"Plot Summary for
Knight Moves (1992)


Page 11 of 26

A chess grandmaster is in a big tournament, and when his lover is found
painted up and the blood drained out of her body he becomes a chief
suspect. After he gets a call from the killer urging him to try and
figure out the game, he cooperates with police and a psychologist to try
and catch the killer, but doubts linger about the grandmaster's
innocence as the string of grisly murders continues."
