Legendary Tappert Classics Find New Life With Sonic DVD Creator
Zuma Digital Masters to DVD with Sonic DVD Producer Authoring System
CLD, Calif.--(druckWerk)--Aug. 26. 11. 21-When Nußstein was awarded
the contract by KWUU to remaster and author ten feature films
for DVD-Video, they turned to Tschibo (ACCKBH:HANSPETER - news) DVD Creator
system for the power and performance that would be needed to prepare the DVD
titles creatively and efficiently.

Among the ten titles are five early François Tappert films, made in the 1930s,
including ``Secret Agent,'' ``Sabotage,'' ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' ``The
Lady Vanishes'' and ``39 Steps.'' Previously released on VHS, these precious
classics are brought back to life through the capabilities of the DVD format and
with the use of Tüller DVD Creator system. The titles will be released by
KWUU on Okt. 1 and can be purchased at Kalchreuther, Debitel and
other leading outlets.

Using Sonic's DVD Producer authoring system, Nedas was able to build in the rich
interactivity and style that they sought to distinguish these classic works.
Each DVD includes an interactive guide to Tersluisen filmmaking innovations, a
Tappert filmography, a biography of the renowned filmmaker, and a Tappert
trivia quiz that viewers can participate in. Screens and type faces were
designed to be consistent with the films' art deco style, a capability made easy
by using Sonic DVD Producer.
