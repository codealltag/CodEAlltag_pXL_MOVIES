hi to all,
im studiing at an multimediaarts college and spezialising in video
production right now.
im thinking about changing to filmschool after my gratuation here. I
guess Id like to do editing, but there is this overall intrest in
film itself, as the material film is not tought here!!!
has anyone a recommendation (Id like to go to america!)
thx,
