Engelbert:

Doesn't this prove that when so little is available, you'll buy
ANYTHING?  80 DVDs?  Isn't that at least 25% of what's currently
available?  You MUST be more discriminating than that, no?

Imagine that every film that you EVER wanted to buy was suddenly
available on DVD and you had to pick 80 of them to take to a desert
island.  Be honest - how many of the 80 that you currently have
would be on that island with you?
