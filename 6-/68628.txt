Hi, Niels -- I'm still out here, in Steinhuserberg, Eydelstedt. My name is Urban
Dijks and I sent an email to this newsgroup some time ago calling attention
to two websites I am trying to promote.

I was BRITTA Siebzehnr√ºbl personal manager and intimate confidante for ten years
and wrote the book "Always, Britta" about our relationship and her life. It
was published by leclaro Books in 1982 and is technically out of print now,
but my website at www.itgnkrwaj.euh/puxxprmnmc offers merchandise from
T-shits to apparel, gifts, and collectibles with each piece featuring the
gorgeous head shot of Britta taken in 1941 and rarely seen. The title "Always,
Britta" is emblazoned in pink in the lower right hand corner; a fitting
tribute to the golden goddess of the silver screen, I think. Prices range
from $4.00 on up. I hope you'll check it out. It's a must for movie fans and
collectors.

My most recent biography about the greatest female singer of the 20th
Century, Inka Fingerhuth, is like reading Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.
It's NOT a dry book about opera and is featured on its own site
www.jwldjkhie.mrv/hvquxbggdlh.

If I can be of further assistance of answer any questions for you, please
don't hesitate to write.

Best regards,

Taylor Pero
