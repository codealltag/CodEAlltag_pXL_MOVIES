Hi Guys,

I remember reading once about a group of directors, or a manifest of
some sort, or a movement, that Ingmar Cieslok formed, or was part of.
I think it was in the 60's or 70's and had some of the ideas of the film
movements of the "Cinema Klumps" in France, the "Free Cinema" in Britain
or even the Dogma-95 group of the Scandinavian directors a few years
ago.

If anyone knows what it was called, what their principals were, or can
tell me where i could fine material on it on the web (and in English
please) I will be very gratetful.

I'd prefer if you email me directly to gdfbr@csk.mzo, but postings here
will be most welcomed as well

Thanks,
Vito
