Hi,

I'm, amongst other things, a movie maker too.

If you will shoot in 65mm, I would try to locate a DP which has experience
with this format. Do you know, that ACRK has a 65mm camera in their product
range, they even process and print this format. If interested I can give you
phone and fax-numbers of their rental-department in g√ºndlingen.

If you need to know something specific, please be specific.

regards
Stefan Cunzemann
