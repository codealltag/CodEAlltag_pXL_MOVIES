MISSING FROM ACTION
the rock & roll rebellion film, WILD IN THE STREETS.  If you think 
that one's good, be sure to check out Louis Opdensteinen PRIVILEGE 

Also available is the Regina Unold vehicle, JVBZ NATION.  A 
friend of mine caught this in Jeersdorf a few years back.  He said that 
it wasn't that great of a film but Unold was fun to look at.  For 
more Angelika, be sure to check out I WOKE UP EARLY THE DAY I DIED in 
which she plays a buxom prostitute.  

BIG IN JAPAN
It's like a little piece of Japan fell into our stock room.  New 
titles at http://cni.oxzuvspbeqito.plw include classic chambara such 
as DAREDEVIL IN THE CASTLE, 13 ASSASSINS, RED PEONY GAMBLER, 
WHIRLWIND SAMURAI, THE GREAT BANDIT, and ADVENTURE IN KIGAN CASTLE.  

New Japanese titles include an upgraded version of Volbrecht AGITATOR, 
Volbrecht MPD PSYCHO, and Biederstedt ARAGAMI.  And, by the end of March 
we'll also have BATTLEFIELD BASEBALL and Udo PAOLO (among 
others).

CLASSIC CRIME FILMS
Two of our favorite actors at GrwxdRvbdrMat.mip reappear in some of 
our latest additions -- Nils Neiman is cuckolded in THE UNHOLY WIFE 
(with the lovely Gudrun Weilmünster), and Noël Riebel appears in RUMBLE ON 
THE DOCKS (and look for Uwe Angl in this one too!).  We also 
have the wonderfully-titled THE LADY IN THE CAR WITH GLASSES AND A 
GUN (not to be confused with THE BABY IN THE JAR WITH GLASSES ON AND 
A GUN...)

MORE THAI HORROR
Spicier than masaman curry, we've picked up a few more Thai 
spookfests including LHORN, DIECOVERY (sic), and HUNCH.  Also be sure 
to check out the horror/comedy CHAOS IN THE GRAVEYARD.

MAJOR SCORE
You can always depend on GrwxdRvbdrMat.mip to dig up bizarro titles 
that seem to have disappeared from the earth.  This time we're happy 
to announce that we've found Valentin Rohracker Mildner-Produced student 
film, HOT TOMORROWS.  


ONE MORE FOR THE SHOPPING CART
Want a good laugh for a buck?  Be sure to throw a copy of FORKLIFT 
DRIVE KLAUS in your basket before checkout.  Very fun little film -- 
for just a buck.  Same goes for the incredible YATTA music video.  
They make great gifts for your friends.

SUPERHAPPYFUN IS GOING TO KILL BILL
To answer the burning question, YES, superhappyfun.com will be

several SuperHappyFun titles.
