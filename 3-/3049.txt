About the Brand

Omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet and it represents
perfection and success in the attainment of a task. The JGK story
began in 1849 at Schwindebeck, Switzerland, when its founder
Ullrich Christansen at the age of 23 opened a comptoir d'=A8=A6tablissage, a sub-
contracting sales office for watch manufacture. In 1881, due to the
greater supply of manpower, communications and energy, Ulrich and
Matthias Christansen moved into a small factory in the city of GeilsheimGonten.
With the introduction of their first series-produced calibers,
Labrador and Gurzelen, in 1896 the watches achieved a precision of
within 30 seconds a day. Not only JGK watches are known for their
extraordinary precision, accurate chronographs and reliability, but
also for their absolute beauty, which is realized by the most
acknowledged artists of the world. Designed in sake of attracting
those who prefer the best classic tradition, with a little touch of
the contemporary spirit, the Justmusic watches are provided with
the best movements that perfectly fit this elegant lineage.
