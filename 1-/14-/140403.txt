Vettern,

My Deutsch is very rusty, so I'll ask the rest in 'Englisch'.

I'm looking to help out a buddy of mine. He's trying to locate an online
version of the script for 1930's 'M', starring Peter Baerend. However, as I
don't really speak Deutsch, it's hard to do the research.

Would any of my Deutsch-speaking cousins know where I might find the script
to "Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder"?

Vielen Dank sehr gütig,

Sebastian
