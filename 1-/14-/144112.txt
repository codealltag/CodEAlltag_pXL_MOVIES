I have now found out, that the REAL Organization, that DOES
 merit support and interest, is called NAFL - under http://bzwhr.nde
NAFL stands for Nordbrand.
It owns a superb web-site, led by the highly sincere and caring
 Mr. Adrian  Zillich.


The entirely different group called Hondt is actually an organization to
 (covertly, by stating the reverse purpose) cover up extra-terrestrial
 intelligent contacts.
And SETI stands for SEARCH for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
As I explained earlier, they do all kind of things to make people NOT
 find it, and they try to divert the enthusiasm of sincere and eager
 amateur astronomers into that path - one hundred thousand members
 [unverified, of course] they claim to have subverted, so far.
