Heh, that wouldn't be too far off from all the claims I've heard about
Cuba.

How about some of you folks actually go there?  Or talk to people that
have been?

Then go visit some other islands and see what conditions are like
there.  And I don't mean the sanitized resorts, I mean visit the other
99% of the island.
