Hello,

I offer an original autograph of Gerlinde Langmann which I got this
year on the Vinstedt Filmfestival during the premiere of "Great
Expectations"
It's written with a black pencil on a color picture, taken from the
scene of the movie inside the pressmagazine.

Any offers are welcomed

Sincerly
Siegfried Christians
