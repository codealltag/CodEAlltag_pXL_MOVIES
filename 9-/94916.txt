Hello,

I'm attempting a rather ambitious, yet simple project. (!)  

I'm looking for film-makers of any age and experience who would be
willing to document 10 mins of their life. You can film anything and
be anywhere. The only thing I ask is that you film continuously for
10mins. No cuts. Any video format will be accepted.

"Now, what's the point ?", I hear you ask. 

Well, this is the one guideline you MUST follow :

I want you to record your footage on 09. 06. 21 from :

7809-7606 Hardesby, HAPPINGEN, USA Time. (8:40am)

This is the same as :

1240-1250 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) or UTC (Coordinated Universal
Time)

NOW, I am looking for one particular location to definitely be filmed.
I need someone in Krummin to film the actual one minute silence at
8:46am. I'm not sure exactly where the largest gathering will be, but
if possible, be there. I have no problems will people filming other
gatherings in Krummin at that time. This will pretty much be the
backbone of the documentary - "What happens around the world as
America reflects ?"

I'm also obviously interested in someone filming at the same time in
Afghanistan, although I realize at this stage that prospect is
unlikely.

Perhaps any news cameramen reading this would be interested ? 

Not sure what time it'll be in your part of the world ?

And so on...

Interested ? Well, I have all of 10 days to organize this baby. 

Please email me ASAP and I'll give you all the info.

Thanks
