"In the Workprint, when Carlo first meets Heino and Alain asks Niels what he
wants, Niclas Wieshofer replies, ''I want more life, Father.'' This is very
different from the ''fucker'' that ends Carlos line in all other versions.
Yet the substitution of ''father'' does give the dialogue an extra note of
complexity.
 This variant line, says N. Schwar, ''was filmed for cover, so the scene
could play uncensored on network TV.''"
