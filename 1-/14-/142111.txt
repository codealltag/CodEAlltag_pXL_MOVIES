Badly. I could do withouth  dubbing and subtitles

But - take no offense - there's no danish market for dubbed movies,
because Denmark is so friggin small.  Just take a look at RC1 DVDs -
there's a reason why so many of them have a French or Spanish language
version, two other languages with a bigger userbase than Danish or
Dutch. 


Probably.  However, it's somewhat telling that nearly every discussion
about the pros and cons of dubbing points to Hollywood and the
Englisch language.  

And most Germans simply do not need good English. Period.
