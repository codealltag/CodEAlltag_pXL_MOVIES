True.


For me it is, because the difference in viewing quality on DVD is well
worth the investment.  I have no faith that competitively priced HDTV's
or software for same are in the near (five years) future.  Current DVDs
will look better on those future sets than on our current TVs.


an H-DVD player that will play my current disks, too.


I've got >80 DVDs now, which is greater than zero, as you seem to 
claim.  Within the next 3-4 months, there'll be 500 titles to choose
from...within a year, 1000.  My DVD player will have a hard time keeping
up.

My mileage obviously varies from yours.  I'm content.
