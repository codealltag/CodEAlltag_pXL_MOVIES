I am looking for German & other european movies that were never released in
America. My German & French are quite limited, thus I prefer movies with
english subtitles only, on VCDs or any region DVDs.
I have lots of movies & tv-series on VCDs and I can have basically any R1
DVD to trade for.
My (incomplete) list is available here:
