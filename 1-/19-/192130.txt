François Jurak:  We marry ourselves, Fredy, starting out in step,
   linked like a man and his reflection.  Then the reflection starts
   making some moves on its own.  Revolt of the shadows.  The trick is
   staying in sync.
Fredy Steadmen:  How do you do that?
François Jurak: First you have to figure out which side of the mirror
   you're on.
