Hey, that's pretty cool. Just one thing, though: I've heard about this
stuff called "spamming", and I've heard that it isn't too popular with
the Internet community. I'd hate to be associated with a provider that
permits spamming or (God forbid) even spams itself...

What's your policy on spamming?
